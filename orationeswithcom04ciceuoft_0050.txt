28 ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

subsellia dissiparit, urnas dejecerit, eas denique omnes res in judicio
disturbando commiserit, quarum rerum caussa judicia sunt con—
stituta? sciasne tum fugisse Memmium? accusatores esse tuos de
tuis tuorumque manibus ereptos? judices quaestionum de proximis
tribunalibus esse depulsos? in foro, luce, inspectante populo Ro-
mano, quaestionem, magistratus, morem majorum, leges, judices,
reum, poenam esse sublatam? haec omnia sciasne diligentia G.
Memmii publicis tabulis esse notata atque testata? Atque illud
etiam quaem, quum, posteaquam es postulatus, ex legatione redieris,
ne quis te judicia ,defugere arbitraretur, teque, quum tibi utrum
velles liceret, dictitaris caussam dicere maluisse, qui consentaneum
fuerit, quum legationis perfugio uti noluisses, appellatione impro-
bissima te ad auxilium nefarium confugisse?

XV. Et quoniam legationis tuae facta mentio est, volo audire

judicibus, quorum et certus numerus de
caussa pronuntiare debebat). But it is
argued by Osenbrueggeu that though the
praetor was ‘ quaestionis praeses perpetuus,’
it was the practice to choose a ⁴ judex quaes-
tionis ¹ for the several trials. The praetor’s
office was to prepare matters for trial, and
when all was ready to appoint both the
,Iudices and the ‘judex quaestionis.' If this
is not the true explanation, the Scholiast
has in this note confounded the appoint-
ment and challenge of the Quaesitores with
the appointment and challeuge of the Ju-
dices. And the Scholiast has certainly
made one mistake, for he says that this
disturbance took place when Vatinius was
prosecuted De vi by C. Licinius3 but
Mommsen observes that the Scholiast has
confounded the later prosecution of C. Li-
cinius (B.c. 54) with the prosecution under
the Lex Licinia et Junia, which Vatinius
had undergone in B.c. 58.

On the word ‘urnas ’ Manutius says “ qui-
bus tabellae judicum servabantur.'' But
Wunder, Proleg. ad Var. Lectiones, Cic. ex
Cod. Erfurt. p. 161, 165, maintains that these
‘urnae' were set there for the purpose of
determining the J udices, and that there were
as many ‘ urnae ’ as there were ‘Judicum
ordines‚' out of which ‘ urnae ’ were drawn
by lot the names of those who were to serve
as Judices. This is the meaning here
certainly. Halm however observes that
Wunder, who affirms that an ¹ urna’ or
‘sitella’ was not used for collecting the
tabulae of the Judices. has been confuted in
this point by Car. Beier in Iahn. Ann.
(1827), Vol. 4. p. 30, διο.

judices· quaestionum] It appears that

various trials were going on at the same
time ς and we are told that in this confusion
the presiding judges of the other courts also
were kicked out of their seats (tribunalia) 3
a state of disorder which seems to us in
modern times almost incomprehensible, at
least such things could happen iu no modern
European state.

ex leqatione] It is said that he went as
legatus to Caesar into Gallia3 and there
having notice of a prosecutiou under the
Lex Licinia et J unia, he returned to Rome,
that it might not be said that he used his
privilege of a legatus to protect himself
against a prosecution 3 for by a Lex Mem-
mia, a man could not be prosecuted while
he was absent on public business. Manu-
tius refers to the story about the orator M.
Antonius (Valerius Maximus iii. 7, 9), who,
when he was on his road to Asia as Quaestor,
being informed by letter that he was charged
with ‘incestum ’ at Rome, returned to the
city to meet the charge, ‘quum id vitare
beneficio legis Memmiae liceret ;’ and Halm
refers to Cicero, Ad Att. iv. 15.—‘auxilium: ’
by appealing to the collegium of tribunes.

15 leyatz'om's tuae] One legatio of
Vatinius is mentioned c. 5. The other
legatio was after his tribunate, and Cicero
is here speaking of the second legatio. As
to the legati being appointed by the Senate,
see Pro P. Sestio, c. 14.-—‘tua lege:’ the
Lex of Vatinius De Imp. C. Caesaris, by
which Caesar got the province of Gallia
Cisalpina and Illyricum, to v( hich the Senate
added Gallia Comata, through fear, says
Suetonius, that if they did not give it, the
people would (Sueton. Caesar, c. 22). It
seems that Caesar repaid Vatinius by making
