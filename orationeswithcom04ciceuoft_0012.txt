to the most conspicuous position in the Roman state after Caesar.
In one difficult emergeucy he showcd judgment and energy, in the
affair of Catilina and his associate& and we may admit that he was,
as Augustus is reported to have said of him, “a wise man and a
lover of his country ².'“ But he lived in difficult times, and found
himself in an awkward position between opposing factions ; and
this with his great timidity, which however he vehemently denied,
as timid people do more than the courageouS, is some excuse for
his irresolution, insincerity, and duplicity. After being humbled to
the (lust by his exile and by Caesar’s usurpation, he rose again and
maintained a last and desperate struggle against M. Antonius and
his faction. He was the only man in the senate, so far as we know,
who shewed either honesty or com-age in prosecuting the war
against Antonius. He knew it was a contest for his own life, and
he perished in the fight, betrayed by men in whom he trusted, and
outwitted by the boy, as he called young Caesar.

No man can read Cicero’s Orations and his Letters without dis-
covering that he falls far below the measure of a generous, sincere,
and noble character. The evidence against him is himself. Some
of my notes in which I have made remarks about him might lead a
reader to suppose that I have taken a pleasure in pointing out the
weak or the bad parts of his charaete1·; but Ι am conscious that
I have had no intention to do so, that when Ι began this work I
had a better opinion of him, and it is not my fault if a man's cha-
racter will not stand against the evidence which he has himself pro-
duced. I believe that as a private man, though very vain and
resentful, he was much better than most of his contemporaries3
and as to his public life, we must make the same liberal allowance
which ought to be made to all men who are engaged in prolitical
matters. We must admit that it is very difficule for a statesman
to be perfectly honest, even if he wishes it, for he must try to please
a great many people, and often get to good ends, or such as he
thinks good, by indirect and crooked ways. We may also certainly
conclude that he who is strictly honest and unbending, is not fit for
the direction of political affairs, though he may be very useful in
