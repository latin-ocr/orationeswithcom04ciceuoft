114 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

esse, ejus non solum tribunatus, sed ctiam perniciosissimae res
auspiciorum religione conservata jure latae videbuntur? Quare
aut vobis statuendum est legem Aeliam manere, legem Fufiam non
esse abrogatam, non omnibus fastis legem ferri licere; quum lex
feratur, de caelo servari, obnuntiari, intercedi licere3 censorium
judicium ac notionem et illud morum severissimum magisterium non
esse nefariis legibus de civitate sublatum3 si patricius tribunus pl.
fuerit, contra leges sacratas, si plebeius, contra auspicia fuisse:
aut mihi concedant homines oportet in rebus bonis non exquirere
jura ea, quae ipsi in perditis non exquirant3 praesertim quum ab=
illis aliquoties conditio C. Caesari lata sit ut easdem res alio modo
ferret, qua conditione auspicia requirebant, leges comprobabant3
in Clodio auspiciorum ratio sit eadem, leges omnes sint eversae ac
perditae civitatis.

XX. Extremum illud est. Ego, si essent inimicitiae mihi cum C.
Caesare, tamen hoc tempore rei publicae consulere, inimicitias in
aliud tempus reservare deberem. Possem etiam summorum virorum
exemplo inimicitias rei publicae caussa deponere. Sed quum inimi-
citiae fuerint numquam, opinio injuriae beneficiov sit exstincta, sen-

were legal, which were done in his illegal
tribunate, because he did them in legal
form ?

leqem Aeliam . . . Fufiam] As to this
Lex or these two Leges see Vol. iii. Index.
One of the provisions, as we see, was, that
a law could not be enacted ⁴ omnibus fastis
diebus,' for all ‘ fasti dies ' were not ⁴ dies
comitiales⁷ according to this Lex, which
Clodius had repealed. Cicero concludes
that they must either admit all that he men-
tions, “aut vobis statuendum . . . contra
auspicia fuisse‚'’ or they must make this
concession to him <aut mihi concedant, διο..)
111 the first case they must ad mit that the Lex
Aelia remains, that the Fufia has not been
repealed 3 that all ⁴ dies fasti ’ are not ‘ comi-
tiales;’ that when a Lex is proposed there
may still be ‘ de caelo servare‚’ and the
‘obnuntiatio ;' that the censors⁷ jurisdiction
and power of punishing have not been de-
stroyed by abominable laws ; that if Clodius
was a patriciam he had been elected contrary
to the Leges Sacratae3 if he was a plebeian,
he was elected contrary to the auspicia.

Clodius had weakened the censorial power
by not permitting a single censor to exercise
his censorial power by inflicting ‘ignominia ι’
the two censors must agree about it. He
also did not permit the censors to omit any
senator ⁴ in senatu legendo.’

In place of the word ‘ notionem' some

old commentators would read ‘ notationem‚’
but Cicero uses ‘notio ' also in this sense.
(Pro Sestlo, c. 25, Vol. iii.)

leyes sacratas] If Clodius was a patri-
cian, then his election to the tribunate was
against the Leges Sacratae, against those
fundamental laws which secured to the
plebeians magistrates out of their own body.
If he was a plebeian his election was illegal,
for Lentulus on that occasion ‘ de eaelo ser-
vavit! On the Leges Sacratae, see Index,
Vol. iii.

aut milli concedant] “ Or they must
allow me, when measures are good, not to
examine too minutely into the rules of law,
which they do not examine into when the
measures are bad3 especially too as they
several times proposed to Caesar to carry
the same measures in another way, and by
making this proposal they only asked for the
observance of the auspices3 they gave their
approbation to the leges themselves ; in the
case of Clodius let there be the same princi-
ple as to the auspices, let all the leges be
considered as leges which were enacted in
a state revolutionized and ruined.”

20. summorum virorum exemplo] The
example of the ¹ summi . . viri ' mentioned
in c. 9 and 10.—‘ inimicitiae ι’ 500 c. 17, and
c. 17 and 18, which explains ‘ opinio in-
juriae.'
