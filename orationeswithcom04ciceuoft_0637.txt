INTRODUOTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ ΝΙΝΤΗ PHILIPPIC.

SER. SULPICIUS, one of the three commissioners sent to Antonius, died
near the camp about Mutina, before the message of the senate was de-
livered to Antonius. The consul Pansa brought before the senate the
question of the honours to be paid to the deceased commissioner. P.
Servilius proposed a public interment and a sepulchre at the public cost,
but he was of opinion that Servius was not entitled to the honour of a
statue, which was only given to those who had been killed on a mission.
Cicero was in favour both of the public funeral and sepulchre and the
statue, and his motion for the statue was carried. Pomponius (Dig. i.
2. 2, ξ 43) speaks of the statue of Servius as existing in his time : “ Hic
(Servius) quum in legatione periisset, statuam ei populus Romanus pro
rostris posuit et hodieque exstat pro rostris Augusti.’‘

Cicero in this oration speaks of the great qualities of Servius and of
his great knowledge of the law (c. 5). A sound understanding, a good
education, diligence, and an honest purpose, made him what he was.
(See the Introduction to the oration Pro Murena, Vol. iii.) The de-
struction of the numerous writings of Sulpicius is a great loss, for the
method in which he handled the matter of law would have been instruc-
tive to us. But he formed a great number of pupils, among whom were
A. Ofilius and Alfenus Varus. Ofilius was the master of Tubero, La-
beo, and Capito. The Digest of J ustinian contains fifty-four extracts
from the Digesta of Alfenus Varus, a work in forty books, which may
have been an edition of a work of Servius, or an arrangement of 1118
master's labours. Alfenus is 1110 only pupil of Servius from whose
writings any excerpts have been preserved in J ustinian’s Digest3 but
Servius, like other great teachers, lived in his pupils more than in his
writings, and was one of those illustrious men who contributed to 1110
development of Roman law. Though there is no extract from Servius
in the Digest, the high esteem in which he was held by Subsequent
jurists is shown by 1110 fact of his being osten cited3 and so we may
infer that his works were sorgotten mainly because they were used by
others whose labours at a later period took the place of 1110 works of this
early jurist.
