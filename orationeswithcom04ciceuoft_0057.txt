INTRODUOTION. 35

L. Sempronius Atratinus the father for ambitus. Atratinus was de-
fended by Cicero, and acquitted (B.c. 57); but Caelius, we are told in

ἢ this oration, was renewing the prosecution in some form. But in Rc.

56 Caelius himself was prosecuted by Atratinus the son, on a charge of
having borrowed from Clodia, with whom he had cohabited‚ some of her
gold ornaments or vessels, for the purpose of procuring the death of
Dion an ambassador from Alexandria3 and on the further charge of
attempting to poison Clodia after he had quarrelled with her or deserted
her. Caelius spoke for himself, and M. Crassus and Cicero also spoke
for him. Caelius was acquitted. Caelius was tr. pl. in B.c. 52, and [a
partizan of O. Caesar. In B.c. 51 he was elected curule aedile for 'the
following year. When Caesar was in North Italy in 13.c.49‚ Caelius
left Rome and joined him, and he served under Caesar in Spain in that
year, as we learn from two of his letters to Cicero (Ad Fam. viii. 16 and
17). In B.c. 48 he was Praetor, and his turbulent conduct in his office
caused such disturbance‚ that he left Rome, pretending that he was
going to Caesar. He was killed before Thurii by some Spanish and
Gallie cavalry in Caesar’s service, whom he had endeavoured to persuade
to surrender the place (Caesar, B. C. iii. 20—22).

The speech which Caelius delivered on this occasion in his own defence
is entitled ‘ pro se de vi ' by Suetonius (De Clar. Rhet. 2) 3 and also ἲ (16
vi ’ by Quintilian (Inst. xi. 1, 51).

Waechter (quoted by Orelli, Cicero, Index Legum) has a long dis-
cussion on the Lex Plautia or Plotia de vi, the oldest law that the Ro-
mans had on this matter. The orations of Cicero which refer to this
Lex are the Pro Sestio, Pro M. Caelio, and Pro Milone. The oration
Pro Milone however refers chiefly to a Lex Pompeia de vi, which
was enacted 13.c. 523 and we learn nothing about the Plautia- from
the oration Pro Sestio.

Caelius, as this oration shows, was charged with several offences which
came under the description of ‘ vis: and also with some other matters,
such as ‘seditiones Neapolitanae, Alexandrinorum legatorum pulsatio,
bona Pallae 3’ also with hiring slaves to assassinatc Dion the legatus of
the Alexandrini, and to poison their own mistress Clodia: The first
part of these charges related more (lirectly to the Lex Plautia, and M.
Crassus defended Caelius against them. Cicero spolie on the second
charges. He had nothing to say to the charges Dc vi, because the points
to which he had to speak had nothing to do with this matter (c. 230).
The only two passages in which he alludes to the Lex de vi arc c. 1 and
29. From this second passage it has been inferred that there was also
a Lex Lutatia de vi proposed by the consul Q. Lutatius Catulus uc. '7 S,
the year of L. Sulla's death. There is no authority for the existence of
such a Lex except this passage.
