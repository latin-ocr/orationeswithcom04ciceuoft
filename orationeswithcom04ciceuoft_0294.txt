272 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

mea caussa facturos, quod me esse gratum crimineris? an, quum
patres conscripti illo senatusconsulto, quod in monumento Marii
factum est, quo mea salus omnibus est gentibus commendata, uni
Cn. Plancio gratias egerint—unus enim fuit de magistratibus
defensor salutis meae—cui senatus pro me gratias agendas putavit,
ei ogo a me referendam gratiam non putem? Atque haec quum
vides, quo me tandem in te animo putas esse, Laterensis? ullum
esse tantum periculum, tantum laborem, tantam contentionem,
quam ego non modo pro salute tua, sed etiam pro dignitate defu-
gerem? Quo quidem etiam magis sum, non dicam miser, nam hoc
quidem abhorret a virtute verbum, sed certe exercitus, non quia
multis debeo,—leve enim [est] onus beneficii gratia,—sed quia
saepe concurrunt [propter] aliquorum bene de me meritorum inter
ipsos content-iones, ut eodem tempore in omnes verear ne vix possim
gratus videri. Sed ego [haec] meis ponderibus examinabo, non
solum quid cuique debeam, sed etiam quid cujusque intersit, et quid
a me cujusque tempus poscat. XXXIII. Agitur studium tuum,
vel etiam si vis existimatio, laus [aedilitatis] ε at On. Plancii salus⁷

I fear I can scarcely show myself grateful
to all at the same time.’

In this sentence he is stating a Stoical
doctrine. Garatoni quotes from Paradox.
11 : “ ut improbo et stulto et inerti nemini
bene esse potest, sic bonus vir et fortis et
sapiens miser esse non potest.’' ‘ Onus ' is
joined with ¹ beneficii,’ as Bake suggests.
(See c. 30, ‘onus beneficii.’) The word
‘ propter ' cannot stand if we take the read-

z'n monumento Marii] “ In templo
scilicet Honoris et Virtutis, in quo actum
primum videtur de restitutione Ciceronis''
(Schol. Ambros.). See Pro Sestio, c. 54,
and the note.—‘ unus enim . . . non putem ?’
I have followed Baiter in the punctuation
of this passage, who says ‘⁴ recte hunc locum
primus distinxit Arn. Schaefer De locis non-
nullis Ciceronis, Plinii, Frontonis, Dresd.
1844, p. 7.’' The punctuation in Wunder's

and in other editions is ‘⁴ egerint, (unus
enim fuit de magistratibus defensor salutis
meae, cui senatus pro me gratias agendas
putavit) ei . . . non putem ?’' But this
does not show the meaning, and Ernesti
was right in requiring-the subjunctive, ‘ pu-
taret‚’ if this punctuation was retained.

Atque haec] T. E. ‘ Atqui haec‚’ Wun-
der.—‘ defugerem :' Τ. Ε. have ‘ defugerim,'
which, as Wunder remarks, does not express
the meaning, for Cicero says there is nothing
that he would not have done for Laterensis,
if the occasion had offered.

Quo quidem] Cicero has just said that
there is nothing which he would not have
done for Laterensis. ‘ And for this reason
I am the more, I will not say unhappy,—
for that is a term incompatible with virtue,
-but at least pcrplexed, not because I am
under obligation to inany,—for the burden
of a kind act is lightencd by gratitude,—but
because there is often such a conflict among
those who have been my benefactors, that

ing ‘concurrunt,’ which is the best reading.
The other is ‘ concurrit.’—‘ ego [haec]
meis :’ Wunder omits ‘haec‚’ for which he
gives reasons in his Prolegomena‚ p. liii.
33. Ayz'tur . . [aedilitatis] ] ‘Studium‚’ as
Wunder explains it, is Laterensis' eagerness
to get a victory in this trial over the man
who had defeated him at the election3 and
this is the true meaning. ‘ With you the
struggle is for victory here, or, if you choose
to have it so, your reputation is at stake3
your credit (laus).’ The best MSS. have
‘aedilitatis:' the others have ‘aedilitas ς’
but neither word offers a meaning, and
Wunder supposes that it was added by
somebody to explain the word ⁴ laus?—
Ieepius, quoted by Baiter, proposes ⁴ laus
sedulitatis.' Garatoni and Orelli thought
that ‘laus aedilitatis ' is an appropriate ex-
pression, because if Plancius were convicted
of bribery‚ Laterensis would have the aedile-
ship. But Wunder correctly remarks that
this is in itself not very probable, and what
