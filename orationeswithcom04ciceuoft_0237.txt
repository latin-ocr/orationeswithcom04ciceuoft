INTRODUOTION. 215

vassers than the proud Patricians. The Lex forbade canvassing on the
market-days and in the country villages. The Forum and the Campus
were the proper places for canvassing the electors in. In B.c. 314, it
was deelared, “coitiones honorum adipiscendorum caussa adversus rem
publicam esse '' (Livy ix. 26). These ‘ coitiones' were clubs or associa-
tions made for election purposes ; election committees and meetings to
secure votes. The ‘ nobiles’ laid all the blame of such associations on
the ‘ novi homines,’ who having less to rely on than their noble oppo-
nents, would be more likely to solicit votes in all ways.

The first Lex against bribery (ambitus) was enacted in Rc. 181 111 the
consulship of P. Cornelius Cethegus and M. Baebius Tamphilus (Liv.
xl. 19). Another Lex named Cornelia was enacted in B.c. 159. Livy
(Epit. 47) merely says, “ lex de ambitu lata:’' but the Schol. Bob. ad
Or. pro Sulla, c. 5, say that a Lex Cornelia incapacitated a man during
‘ren years for being a candidate for a magistratus, if he had been con-
victed of ambitus. It is not certain what Lex Cornelia this is. It has
been supposed that it was a Lex of the Dictator L. Cornelius Sulla, but
there appears to be no evidence to prove this assumption.

In Rc. 139 a Lex Gabinia enacted that the voting at the Comitia
should be by ballot (tabellae), and not orally as before. There could be
no object 111 this Lex except to secure the voter against iutimidation by
enabling him to give his vote secretly‚ and perhaps also to prevent
bribery, for we may assume that bribery was used at this time. If the
object was to prevent bribery, secret voting might in some degree
effect that end. Cicero (Pro Plancio, c. 6) is eloquent on the ad-
vantages to the voter of secret voting: the elector can promise one
thing and do another. A German writer (Rein) says of the vote by
ballot: “ An opportunity for bribing was presented by the Lex Gabinia
(tabellaria). By this innovation it was scarcely any longer possible to
control the voters, and those who were bribed could not be distinguished
from those who were not bribed.’' This is the remark of a man who is
perfectly ignorant of the nature of voting.

A Lex was enacted in the tribunate of O. Marius, 13.c. 119, called
Lex Maria. We know no more of it than Cicero tells us (Dc Legg. iii.
15, 17). Cicero says he is of opinion that “nothing is better than open
voting‚ but it is a matter of doubt if this can be secured (obtineri).''
Quintus, who replies to his brother Marcus in the Dialogue‚ says, “this
is an opinion which misleads the inexperienced, and very often does
mischief to the state, when a thing is said to be just and right ; bnt it
18 maintained that it cannot be sccured (obtineri), that is, the peoplo
cannot be resisted (id est obsisti posse populo negatur) ;’' in which
words he explains the meaning of ‘obtineri' He adds that thc Lex
tabellaria deprived the nobles (optimates) of all influence, and that the
