INTRODUCTION. 37

probably in form also. The history of Roman law shows that the later
Leges were founded on the earlier, which they modified as circumstances
required. The passage in Paulus ‘quive cum telo in publico fuerit’
compared with a passage of Cicero (Ad Att. ii. 24) already referred to,
helps to confirm this: “fit SCtum ut Vettius quod confessus esset se
cum telo fuisse in vincula conjiceretur ;’' and in the same letter he says
afterwards what has been already quoted (5). XVhen Catilina was
threatened with a prosecution under the Lex Plautia, as Sallust tells us
that he was (c. 31), we may conclude from another passage (c. 27) what
offences he was charged with under this Lex: ‘⁶ Interea (Catilina) Romae
multa simul moliri, consuli insidias tendere, parare incendia, opportuna
loca armatis hominibus obsidere, ipse cum telo esse, item alios jubere,
hortari uti semper intenti paratique essent.’' If we compare this pas-
sage with the words of Paulus, we find that these acts of Catilina would
have brought him within the penalties of the later Lex J ulia de τίς and
we may conclude from comparing chap. 27 and 31 that these were the
offences with which he was charged under the Lex Plautia. Accord-
ingly, as Waechter remarks, we cannot conclude from Cicero's words
“qui armati . . . rem publicam oppugnarint ” (Pro M. Caelio, c. 1) that
the Lex Plautia was directed against treason, for Cicero is speaking
oratorically and not quoting the words of the LeX. Catilina was guilty
of ‘ vis’ and also of conspiring against the state, and the surest way of
stopping his designs was to prosecute him for what could be proved
against him; and as we know from the history of the conspiracy, the
proof of a treasonable design was not got till after Catilina had left
Rome. A like remark will explain why the less dangerous conspirators
after the execution of the leaders, were prosecuted De vi only, as Cicero
says (Pro M. Caelio, c. 293 see the Introduction to the oration Pro
P. Sulla, Vol. iii.).

Waechter's conclusion then is perfeetly correct that when Cicero in
this oration speaking of the Lex Plautia uses the words ‘ rem publicam
oppugnarint,’ he means to say no more than that all violence is danger-
ous to the tranquillity of a state. In fact all force, not exerciscd by
virtue of and for the execution of the Law, is an attack on the sovereign
power, which allows no force to be used, except in self-defence or in
obedience to the Law. “ This may be considered as proved particularly
by this fact, that when Clodius a private person was killed by Milo, the
Senate in order to establish for that case a ‘judicium extra ordinem ’
made a decree ‘caedem hanc contra rem publicam factam ;’ and Cicero
explains this by the remark, that no force can be exercisod among eiti-
zens in a free state, which does not also touch the state itsclf; :md
accordingly all force in a measure is an act ‘contra rem publicam ‘
(Cicero, Pro Milone, c. 5: ‘quia nulla vis unquam est in libera civitate
