2 IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM.

Comitia Praetoria were put off to the next year, and in February 13.c. 55
Vatinius was elected praetor. In B.c. 54 he was prosecuted under the
Lex Licinia dc Sodaliciis, and Cicero defended him. This is all that is
necessary to know of Vatinius for the purpose of reading this oration.

Cicero had attacked Vatinius in the speech for Sestius, though his
name is not mentioned. The witnesses were heard on Sestius' trial, accord-
ing to the practice, after the speeches for the defendant, and Vatinius
gave evidence against Sestius. Witnesses could be cross examined, and
the orators could speak generally for or against the credibility of the
witnesses, as Cicero did against Vatinius on this occasion. Quintilian
(Inst. Or. v. 7) says: “Cum praesentibus (testibus) vero ingens dimi-
catio est, ideoque velut duplici contra eos proque his acie confligitur,
Actionum et Interrogationum. In Actionibus primum generaliter pro
testibus atque in testes dici solet—Interim adversus singulos dirigitur
acti03 quod insectationis genus et permixtum defensioni legimus in ora-
tionibus plurimis, et separatim editum, sicut In Vatinium testem.”

This speech against Vatinius is partly intended to destroy his credit
as a witness, but mainly to gratify Cicero’s own revengeful feelings. It
is a violent attack on the man in the form of a series of questions which
refer to all his life, private and public. It is not an examination or set
of questions to which Cicero requires or expects an answer, for he tells
us so, and the form of the speech shows what it is. It is the actio,
which the patronus had a right to use to destroy the witness’ credibility
and his character too, if he could. This actio was also called by the
general term Interrogatio, as the Scholiast says : “ Erat alia praeterea
Interrogatio testium, sicut ipse M. Tullius P. Vatinium testem interro-
gavit. Proprie namque Interrogatio dicebatur, qua testes redargue-
bantur.” Cicero in a letter to P. Lentulus (Ad Fam. i. 9) tells what
he did in this speech, and why he made this outrageous attack on Vati-
nius. The man had said something about Cicero, which was true ς “Ego
sedente Cn. Pompeio, quum ut laudaret P. Sestium introisset in urbem

dixissetque testis Vatinius me fortuna et felicitate C. Caesaris commotum
illi amicum esse coepisse, dixi me eam Bibuli fortunam quam ille afflictam
putaret omnium triumphis victoriisque anteferre: dixique eodem teste

alio loco eosdem esse qui Bibulum exire domo prohibuissent et qui
me coegissent: tota vero interrogatio mea nihi] habuit nisi reprehen-
sionem illius tribunatus, in quo omnia dicta sunt libertate animoque
maximo de vi, de auspiciis, de donatione regnorum.'’ Cicero in a letter
to his brother Quintus (ii. 4) after informing him of Sestius’ acquittal,
tells him that he did what Sestius most wished for3 he made mince meat
of Vatinius (arbitratu nostro concidimus, dis hominibusque plauden-
tibus—Quid quaeris ’.Ρ homo petulans et audax Vatinius valde pertur-
batus debilitatusque discessit).
