virtues of the ballot in the terms which he uses in this speech. Its
virtues 116 111 the power which it gives to a man, whether honest or not,
to vote as he pleases, and, if he likes, to deceive the knave who would
get his vote for money or extort it from him through sear. In some
parts of the United States of North America when a voter goes to the
hustings he is presented with a ballot for each of the candidates, and he
can put into the box any one of the ballots that he pleases, or more
than one if he is voting for more than one person.

In this oration Cicero praises the ballot because it suits his purpose.
In his treatise De Legibus (iii. 15) 116 declares his opinion in favour of
open voting, or voting by word of mouth. He says that the vote by
ballot had destroyed all the influence of the nobles, or whatever 116
means by ‘ optimates 3' and this is very strong evidence in favour of the
value of the ballot. It is his opinion that the ‘ boni,’ a very indefinite
class, to which 116 belonged himself, should know how the rest, who
were not ‘boni‚’ voted; for if the ‘boni’ did not know each man’s
opinion, the ‘ ballot might conceal a vicious vote.’ He has however for-
gotten to tell us how the ‘ boni ' are to be determined ; nor has he ob-
served that if the rest ought to vote as the ‘ boni’ wish, the ‘ boni' might
as well have all the votes and leave the rest without. In another pas-
sage (iii. 17) he would allow the people to have the ballot as a kind of
safeguard of their liberty, “provided the tablet is shown and readily pre-
sented to all the best citizens and men of the weightiest character.'’ ΤΟ
make any sense of such a proposal he ought to have pointed out some
way of selecting this choice body of judges who should superintend the
voting, and of course refuse or correct a vote if it did not please them.
But though he has all this absurdity, Cicero has not gone so far as some
of the present opponents of the ballot, who say that the electoral fran-
chise is a trust, and yet they do not tell us how we must proceed
against the trustee if he neglects his duty, and who must call him to
account for giving his vote to one man rather than another3 nor do these
foolish people see that it follows from the very nature of an election

- that a man may give his vote to any candidate, nor do they see that if

he promises his votc from a corrupt motive, it is less likely that the cor-
rupter will get the vote if the elector can give it secretly, than if he
must give it openly. Nor do these people see that in a matter in
which two knaves are concerned, the briber and the bribed, that plan of
voting is best which makes the principal knave least secure of getting
what he bargains for. There may be reasons against the vote by ballot
in any case, and there are good reasons against using it in all the cases
in which the Romans used it; but nobody has yet discovered sufficient
reasons against using it in popular elections, in which it is assumed,
and indeed admitted on all sides, that he who is a voter has full liberty
