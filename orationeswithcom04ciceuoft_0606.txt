584 INTRODUCTION.

stated in the Lex, that Antonius should take possession of the province
which had been given to him, and should make war on Decimus Brutus

if he did not give up Gallia to him. He went on to say that Cicero
would not consider Decimus as an enemy to the state, though he was in
arms contrary to the law, and yet he proposed to consider Antonius as
an enemy who was acting according to the law.

After voting that Antonius should have Macedonia instead of Gallia,
“ either through carelessness or purposely, the senate empowered Cicero
to draw up the instructions for the ambassadors to Antonius. But Cicero,
making some alteration, drew them up in these terms: That Antonius
must immediately retire from Mutina, and give up Gallia to Decimus3
that he must withdraw south of the Rubicon, the boundary of Italy and
Gallia, within a certain day, and submit entirely to the senate. Thus
passionately and falsely Cicero drew up the instructions, not so much
from his great enmity, but, as it seems, because the daemon was stirring
up public matters to a change, and plotting mischief against Cicero’'
(Appian, B. O. iii. 613 and compare Phil. vi. c. 3). We must take this
as we receive it. We cannot tell whether it is the truth or not. We
may have our own opinion about the daemon’s share in the business.

It seems that Cicero addressed the people on the 4th of January,
aster the determination of the senate to send ambassadors to Antonius.
