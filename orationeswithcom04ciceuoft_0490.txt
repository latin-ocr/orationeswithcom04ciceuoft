468 ORAT. ‘PHILIPPICARUM LIBER PRIMUS.

plus quam biennium consulares obtinerentur? Hac lege sublata
videnturne vobis posse Caesaris acta servari? Quid, lege, quae
promulgata est de tertia decuria [judicum], nonne omnes judi-
ciariae leges Caesaris dissolvuntur? Et vos acta Caesaris defenditis
qui leges ejus evertitis? nisi forte, si quid memoriae caussa rettulit
in libellum, id numerabitur in actis et quamvis iniquum et inutile
sit defendetur3 quod ad populum centuriatis comitiis tulit, id in
actis Caesaris non habebitur. At quae [est] ista tertia decuria}

tius' means more honourable. A Judex
should have both property and rank (for-
tuna et dignitas).

Cicero is not consistent about the number
of years which the Lex of Antonius allowed
to provincial governors (Phil. v. c. 33 viii.

c. 9 .

teirtia decuria] The Lex Aurelia, B.c.
70, formed three Decuriae, of senators,
Equites, and Tribuni aerarii respectively,
out of which the J udices were taken. Pom-
peius, in his Lex Judiciaria (B.c. 55», re-
tained the Tribuni aerarii3 but there was
SJme property qualification required (census
praefiniebatur). Caesar (nc. 46) put an
end to the Decuria of the Tribuni aerarii,
but he retained the other two (Sueton.
Caesar, c. 41).

qui ordines duoeerzmt] That is, ‘cen-
turiouesss “Qui primum pilum duxerat‚'’
Caesar, B. G. v. 35. Caesar says (Β. G.
v. 30) “primisque ordinibus,” and vi. 7,
‘⁴ tribunis militum primisque ordinibus co-
actis‚'' the tribunes and centurions of the
first class. If the ‘ centuriones’ had the J u-
dicatus before the Lex J ulia, they must have
been included in the Tribuni aerarii.—
‘equo meruisset:7 an Eques, who had a
more honourable service than the infantry.
Halm observes that if a centurion was
made a Tribunus militum, he became of
the equestrian ordo. He also refers to
Livy 41, c. 12 ι “ militibus denarios quinos
vicenos, duplex centurioni, triplex equiti
. . . diviserunt.’'—‘ lautius :’ V. The other
reading is ‘ laudatius' or ‘ laudacius.’ ‘ Lau-

manipulares . . . Alaudarum] The sol-
diers of the legion of the Alaudae (Phil. v.
c. 5). Caesar formed this legion of Trans-
alpine Galli, and gave it a Gallie name,
Alaudae (Sueton. Caes. c. ⁴24, and the notes
in Burmann's edition). Pliny says (N. H.
xi. c. 37) : ‘⁴ In capite paucis animalium nec
nisi volucribus apices diversi quidem generis
. . . praeterea parvae avi, quae ab illo galerita
appellata quondam, postea Gallico vocabulo
etiam legioni nomen dederat alaudae.'’ It
appears that these soldiers were named
Alaudae on account of their crests. Per-
haps it was a military joke. Alauda is the
origin of the French ‘ alouette,' which now
means a lark.—‘ aliter τ’ Antonius is sup-
posed to say this for himself and his fac-
tion: We cannot be safe unless we have a
Decuria of Judices devoted to us, and who
must do what they are bid. Caesar made
all this legion Roman citizens.

contumeliosum] It was an insult to the
soldiers to make them qualified to be
Judices in order to do Antonius' dirty
work. ⁴ Index’ is sometimes the same as
‘titulus.’ Here he means that the sum
total (index) of the Lex means no more
than this, ‘ut ii res . . . non audeant)
Cicero says that the men will be severe and
honest Judices, and labour to show that
