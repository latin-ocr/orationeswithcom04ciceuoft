INTRODUOTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ THIRTEENTH PHILIPPJG.

ΤΗΕ design of sending obher Legati to Antonius had been abandoned,
and Cicero in this orabion maintains that there can be no peace with
Antzonius3 the war must be vigorously prosecuted. M. Lepidus, who
had brought to herms Sex. Pompeius in Spain, for which service the
senate had honoured him with a sbatue (Phil. v. c. 15), had written to
recommend peace with Antonius (c. 4, &c.); and Cicero answers his
recommendation by showing that there can be no peace with a man who
is in arms against the state, and had nob deigned to give an answer to
the commissioners who had been sent (e. 9).

Cicero then reads a lesster from Antonius to Hirtius and Caesar,
which letter or a copy Hirtius had forwarded from Mul-,ina 'no Rome.
Cicero takes the letter clause by clause and makes his remarks on it (c.
10—21)‚ and in such a way as to pub the worst meaning on what Anto-

nius had wribten.
He concludes by agreeing with whab Servilius had said about the

proposals and lether of Lepidus ; and moves ‘uhab Sex. Pompeius should
be ‘uhanked for the offer which he had made of his services.
The consul Pansa had now left Rome to join his colleague Hirtius

before Mutina.
