Convivium publicum non dignitatis caussa inibit,—nisi forte ut curn
patribus conscriptis, hoc est cum amatoribus suis caenet-sed plane
animi sui caussa: ludos nobis idiotis relinquet. Solet enimin dispu-
tationibus suis oculorum et aurium delectationi abdominis voluptates
anteferre. Nam quod vobis iste tantummodo improbus, crudelis, olim
furunculus, nunc vero etiam rapax, quod sordidus, quod contumax,
quod superbus, quod fallax, quod perfidiosus, quod impudens, quod
audax esse videatur, nihil scitote esse luxuriosius, nihil libidinosius,
nihil posterius, nihil nequius. Luxuriam autem nolite in isto hanc
cogitare ; est enim quaedam, quamquam omnis est vitiosa atque
turpis, tamen ingenuo ac libero dignior. Nihil apud hunc lautum,
nihil elegans, nihil exquisitum—laudabo inimicum ;—cui ne magno
opere quidem quidquam praeter libidines sumptuosum. Toreuma
nullum, maximi calices, et ii, ne contemnere suos videatur, Placen-
tini 3 exstructa mensa, non conchyliis aut piscibus, sed multa carne
subrancida. Servi sordidati ministrant, nonnulli etiam senes; idem
coquus, idem atriensis3 pistor domi nullus, nulla cella; panis et
vinum a propola atque do cupa: Graeci stipati, quini in lectulis,
saepe plnres3 ipse solus; bibitur usque eo dum de solio ministretur.

&c.-‘ toreuma :’ see Verr. ii. 2, c. 52, and
the note—⁶ conchyliis ε’ shell-fish and tish
were the delicat-ies of the rich. Piso's table
was loaded with heavy pieces of meat, some-
what tainted. The man was waited on by
dirty slaves, some even old. A man of rank
and taste would havc young and handsomc
slaves. But 11 Pisohad happened tohave such
slaves, we should have had another kind of
imputation made against him. The same
man was cook, and served in the atrium or
entrance-hall, though Cicero does not say
how the wok lookod atter his kitchen and
thc hall-door at the same time. Piso had
neither a broad-imikcr nor a wine cellar.

kept no cellar. Piso managed his house

was that to any body ?

Graeci stipali] Hc packed his Greeks
close, five on a couvh instead of the usual
number three. This shows Piso's hospi-
tality. lle wished to entertain as many of
his friends as hc could. But Piso had a
whole sofa to himself. That was not fair:
he should have shared it with others: and
