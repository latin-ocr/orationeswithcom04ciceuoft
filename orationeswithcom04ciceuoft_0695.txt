postulatur--quamquam vix videntur haec posse sejungi, sejungamus
tamen—fortitudo dimicare jubet, justum odium incendit, ad con-
fligendum impellit, vocat ad periculum. Quid sapientia? cautiori-
bus utitur consiliis, in posterum providet, est omni ratione tectior.
Quid igitur censet? parendum est enim, atque id optimum judican-
dum quod sit sapientissime constitutum. Si hoc praecipit ne quid
vita existimem antiquius, ne decernam capitis periculo, fugiam omne
discrimen, quaeram ex ea, etiamne si erit quum id fecero servien-
dum. Si annuerit, ne ego sapientiam istam quamvis sit erudita non
audiam. Sin responderit: Tu vero ita vitam corpusque servato,
ita fortunas, ita rem familiarem, ut haec libertate posteriora ducas,
itaque his uti velis, si libera re publica possis, nec pro his liber-
tatem, sed pro libertate haec projicias tamquam pignora injuriae—-
tum sapientiae vocem audire videar, eique uti deo paream. Itaque
si receptis illis possumus esse liberi, vincamus odium pacemque
patiamur: sin otium incolumibus his esse nullum potest, laetemur
decertandi oblatam esse fortunam. Aut enim interfectis illis frue-
mur victrice rc publica, aut oppressi, quod omen avertat Jupiter,
si non spiritu, at virtutis laude vivemus.

tamquam pignora injuriae] The words
‘ nec pro his . . . projicias ' explain Cicero's
meaning. A ‘ pignus ' is something which
a man receives from another to keep as a
security for money lent, or it may be for
any thing else. He who holds the ⁴ pignus ’
cannot have his money back without giving
up the ⁴ pignus! This is something like the
case of a ‘ pledge,’ not quite. You give up
your liberty in order that you may keep
your life and your property3 but you had
better give up life and property for the
sake os liberty; though the individual who
gives up his life will not get much advan-
tage by recovering his liberty. Cicero says
⁴ tamquam pignora injuriae,' as if he meant
to say an improper- use of ⁴ pignus ;' and it
is. Your property is a pledge for your
being ill treated. A tyrnnt knowing that
you value your body aud your property
more than liberty, will take advantage of
this, and will make you suffer what he
pleases. Cicero says l’ro Caelio, c. 32,
“ pignora voluntatis.'’

VOL. lv,

Cicero’s talk is good, but his past lise
showed that he would not give up every
thing to save liberty. However here, as on
many other occasions, he tells us a great
truth, which was never more true than it is
now. So much does a nation love its quiet,
its property, the power of making money
and enjoying it,and so greatly has the amount
of material enjoyment been increased in
modern times, that a people will endure
the most scandalous usurpation of power,
and its most tyrannical exemise, rather than
risk the loss of their property and their en-
joyment, which are dearer to them than
liberty, dearer even than 1ife; for if the
tyrant who imprisons and exiles were to
plunder the humbled nation without mercy,
his rulc would soon end.
