454 INTRODUGTION

to take advantage of the popular excitement. However he pacifiecl the
senate for thc time. On the proposal of Ser. Sulpicius, and with the con-
sent of Antonius, it was declared in the senate that no decrees of Caesar
should be put up after the Ides of March3 and that the dictatoria] office
should be abolished (Phil. i. c. 23 Phil. ii. c. 36). Antonius also put
to death one Amatius, a turbulent demagogue, who pretended to be a
descendant of C. Marius, and attempted to stir up the people against
Caesar’s enemies and all the Nobiles. Antonius would not tolerate such
a competitor for the public favour. He soon began to show his real
intentions. Having Caesar’s papers in his possession, he began to put
in execution the dispositions which the Dictator had made. He recalled
banished men from exile, distributed honours, remitted the payment of
taxes, and gave the Roman citizenship to individuals and to whole com-
munities. What he did not find in Caesar’s papers he is said to have
forged with the help of Caesar's secretary Faberius. Antonius got
money from those whom he obliged, and he removed out of the temple
of Ops 700 millions of sestertii, public money which Caesar had placed
there (Phil. i. c. 7 and 10; and Phil. v. c. 4). The conclusion from
Phil. ii. c. 27 is that Antonius seized some of the money in the temple
of Ops before the lst of April. He seems not to have taken it all at
once. It was probably as safe there till he wanted it as any where else.
With such means at his command he could do what he pleased. In
a state which maintains a large military force, a man who seeks power
must gain the soldiers. Antonius with the aid of his brother Lucius
carried an Agraria Lex which gave lands to the old soldiers both in
Italy and Sicily, and Antonius himself was one of seven commissioners
who were appointed to execute the Lex. P. Dolabella, his colleague,
and his brother Lucius, were also commissioners. Antonius made a jour-
ney in Italy in the end of April and the beginning of May with the view,
as it seems, of strengthening his interests with the soldiers who had
received grants of land. Cicero (Phil. ii. c. 39, 8⁵0.) has given an account
of this journey. He returned, says Cicero, with an army at his heels
(Phil. ii. c. 42). .
After Caesar’s return from his last Spanish war, he sent O. Octavius
to Apollonia in Illyricum with the rhetorician Apollodorus. He was to
wait there till the Dictator arrived, and to accompany him on his Par-
thian expedition. On hearing of Caesar's death Octavius resolved to
return to Rome. He landed at Lupiae, near Brundisium, and hearing of
Caesar's testament, and the events that had happened since his death,
he assumed the name of C. Julius Caesar Octavianus. The great
name which he assumed and his own talents made his fortune. The
partizans of Caesar and the old soldiers received him joyfully on his
way to Rome. Cicero, who was staying at Astura, heard of the youth’s
