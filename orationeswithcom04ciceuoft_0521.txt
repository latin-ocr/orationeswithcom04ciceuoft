GAP. 18-20, 499
Domum dico? Quid erat in terris ubi in tuo pedem poneres praeter
unum Misenum, quod cum sociis tamquam Sisaponem tenebas?
XX. Venisti e Gallia ad quaesturam petendam. Aude dicere te
prius ad parentem tuum venisse quam ad me. Acceperam jam
ante Caesaris litteras, ut mihi satisfieri paterer a te. Itaque ne
loqui quidem sum te passus de gratia. Postea sum cultus a te, tu
a me observatus in petitione quaesturae. Quo quidem tempore
P. Clodium approbante populo Romano in foro es conatus occidere,
quumque eam rem tua sponte conarere, non impulsu meo, tamen
ita praedicabas, te non existimare, nisi illum interfecisses, umquam
mihi pro tuis in me injuriis satis esse facturum. In quo demiror
cur Milonem impulsu meo rem illam egisse dicas, quum te ultro
mihi idem illud deferentem numquam sim adhortatus. Quamquam,
siin eo perseverares, ad tuam gloriam rem illam referri malebam
quam ad meam gratiam. Quaestor es factus: deinde continuo sine
senatusconsulto, sine sorte, sine lege ad Gaesarem cucur1·isti; id
enim unum in terris egestatis, aeris alieni, nequitiae perditis vitae
rationibus perfugium esse ducebas. Ibi te quum et illius largitio-

Sisapo is not clear. Turnebus (Adv. x. c.
12) says that he alludes “Ad miniaria
metalla Sisaponensium‚ quae societates Pub-
licanorum exercebant ; dicit enim Antonium
non unum possessorem Miseni fuisse, sed
possessionis socios habuisse niultos.’' The
working of the cinnabar was unwholesome
says Pliny: “qui minium in officinis poli-
unt, faciem laxis vesicis illigant, ne in respi-
rando pernicialem pulverem trahant et ta-
men ut per illas spectent.” Abrami sug-
gests that Antonius' villa was exposed to a
horrible and pestilent wind, that is, was
mortgaged to his creditors, and he quotes
Catullus (xxvi.):

‘¹ Furi, villula nostra non ad Austri
Flatus opposita est nec ad Favoni,
Nec saevi Boreae aut Apeliotae,
Verum ad millia quindecim et ducentos,
O ventum horribilem atque pestilentem.’'

20. Venisti] ⁴ Venis ' (Halm).—‘ quaes-
turam :’ see the Introd.—⁴ parentem tuum 2’
there is also a reading ⁴ patrem tuum.’ M.
Antonius’ father had long been dead, and
his step-father Lentulus was strangled in
ΒΛ). 63. llis mother Julia was alive.
George Buchanan proposed to read ‘pa-
rentem tuam,' or ‘matrem tuam.’ Frut-
scher proposes to write ‘tum ' t'or ‘ tuum,'
the worst alteration that could be pro-
posed. Halm has accepted it. Muretus
proposed to read ‘ amatorem tuum.’

ut mihi satisfieri] The word ‘litteras ’
contains the notion of the request ‘that I
would allow you to make your apology to
me ’ for the past. ⁴ Accordingly,’ says
Cicero, ⁶ I did not even let you spoak about:
a recouciliation ε’ he received Antonius with
open arms, for he had Caesar’s recommen-
dation.—‘ observatus? D., ¹ ovatus' V. ; for
which corrupt reading various conjectures
have been proposed, ‘adjutus,' ‘ornatus,’
and others. ‘Observare,' says Manutius,
“means in this passage to help a man in
his canvass for office in such ways as it was
allowed, by visiting his house, accompany-
ing him abroad, and the like.’' Manutius
shows that ‘observare’ is sometimes used
to express the attention paid by a superior
or an elder to an inferior or a younger.

Quamquam, si in eo] Manutius says
that the sense requires ‘ quoniam,' t'or the
reason is given why Cicero did not. encou-
rage him. But ‘quamquam ' means ¹ airy-
howss ⁴ however? ⁴ if you had persovered
in the matter, Ι was quite willing that all
the credit of it should be yours rather than
mine.y The words ⁸ rem illam referri male-
bam ’ are omitted in V.

sine sorte] It was all irregular. llo
should have waitcd till the Nonae ot' Ue-
cember to have had his Provincia ‹leter-
mined by lot, or he should have been np-
pointed by a vote of the people (lege), or by
a senatusconsultum.
