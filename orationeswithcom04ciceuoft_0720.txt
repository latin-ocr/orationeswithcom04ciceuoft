698 ORAT. PHILIPPIOARUM LIBER XIV.
convenit et eventui reservari, ne aut deorum immortalium bene-
ficium festinatione praeripuisse aut vim fortunae stultitia contemp-
sisse videamur.

Sed quoniam significatio vestra satis declarat quid hac de re sen-
tiatis, ad litteras veniam quae sunt a consulibus et a pro praetore
missae, si pauca ante quae ad ipsas litteras pertineant dixero.
III. Iinbuti [sanguine] gladii sunt, patres conscripti, legionum
exercituumque nostrorum vel madefacti potius duobus duorum con-
sulum, tertio Caesaris praelio. Si hostium fuit, ille sanguis, summa
militum pietas3 nefarium scelus, si civium. Q‘ffij'us'tsw‘elssitifflis‚ qui
omnes hostes scelere superavit, nomine hostis carebit Ξ ᾳ1)ἰεί mucrones x
etiam nostrorum militum tremere vultis dubitantes utrum in cive
an in hoste figantur. Supplicationem decernitis: hostem non
appellatis. Gratae vero nostrae diis immortalibus gratulationes
erunt, gratae victimae, quum interfecta sit civium multitudo! ² De
improbis,' inquit, ‘et audacibus ε’ nam sic eos appellat clarissimus
vir; quae sunt urbanarum maledicta litium, non inustae belli
internecini notae. Testamenta, credo, subjiciunt, aut ejiciunt
vicinoS aut adolescentulos circumscribunt, his enim vitiis affec-
tos et talibus malos et audaces appellare consuetudo solet. μ
Bellum inexpiabile infert quattuor consulibus unns omnium latro-
num taeterrimus3 gerit idem bellum cum senatu populoque Ro-

a way conformable to the real nature of
things. Polybius cut short this kind of
talk when he says (ii. 38) of the origin of
the Achaean power ε “ It is plain that there
would be no propriety in speaking of for-
tune, for that would be trifling3 but we
must rather seek for a cause3 for without a.
cause neither any thing that happens ac-
cording to expectation, nor any thing that
happens contrary to expectation‚ can pos-
sibly take place.'’

siymficatio restra] The signs of assent
which the senate made.

3. [sanynine]] om. a b t v. ‘ Madefacti,'
as Manutius remarks, is less than ‘ imbuti.'
Cicero corrects his expression in order to
show that the swords of the legions had not
yet had enough of the enemy’s blood.

(luobus duorum consulum] These were
the battles fought on the l5rh of April at
Forum Gallorum (Castel Franco), between
the troops of Pansa and Hirtius on one side,
and the soldier-s of M. Antonius on the other.
They are the two battles which Ser. Galba
describes in the letter to Cicero (Ad Div. x.
30). The letter is dated on the ‘20th of
April, and could not be received by Cicero

before the 2lst of April, on which day he
delivered this speech. But there may be
an error in the text in the date of the letter.
Appian's story (B. C. iii. 06—703 Introd.
to Phil. xiv.) is much clearer than Galba’s.
Pansa was wounded in the first battle, and
carried to Bononia (Bologna). The battle
which Cicero calls Caesar’s was fought in
defence of the camp (c. 14) at Mutina, while
Hirtius had gone to help Pansa (Dion 46,
c. 37).

clarissimus vir] P. Servilius. He had
not called them ⁴ hostes.5

inustae belli internecini notae] Halm;
who says ‘ scripsi? But Ferrarius has this
reading. Halm has ¹ internecivi’ in place
of ‘internecini.' Muretus preferred ‘non
justae ’ to ⁴ inustae.’

Testamenta, subjiciunt] They are will-
forgers, I suppose, or men who 'oust their
neighbours from their land, or cheat young
men. Halm writes ‘ malos aut audaces.’

quattuor consulibus] Pansa and Hirtius,
and the two Designati D. Brutus and L.
Plancus3 but L. Plancus was out of the
way in Transalpine Gallia.
