282 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

lissem, ut jam mihi servirem, consulerem meis; se non modo satis
habere a me, sed etiam vereri ne parum mihi pro eo quantum a
mc haberet reddidisset. Quid, si horum ego nihil cogito, et idem
sum in re publica qui fui semper, tamenne libertatem requires
meam? quam tu ponis in eo, si semper cum iis quibuscum ali-
quando contendimus depugnemus. Quod est longe secus. Stare
enim omnes debemus tamquam in orbe aliquo rei publicae, qui
quoniam versatur, eam deligere partem ad quam nos illius utilitas.
salusque converterit„ XXXIX. Ego autem Gn. Pompeium—non
dico auctorem, ducem, defensorem salutis meae-nam haec pri-
vatim fortasse officiorum memoriam et gratiam quaerunt—sed dico
hoc quod ad salutem rei publicae pertinet—ego eum non tuear,
quem omnes in re publiea principem esse concedunt? Ego
G. Caesaris laudibus desim, quas primum populi Romani, nune
etiam senatus, 0111 1110 semper addixi, plurimis atque amplissimis
judiciis videam esse celebratas? Tum hercule 100 confitear non

have ⁴ quam tum‚⁷ which means ⁴ quantum?
The 0011101011 reading is ‘ quod tum! ν

requires] ⁴ Will you still affirm that I
have 1051 my liberty ?⁷ For this is the
meaning of ‘ requires ⁷ here—⁴ stare debe-
mus . . . qui quoniam :' ⁴ deligere ' depends
011 ‘debemus' ‘ For we ought all to con-
sider that we are standing on a kind of
wheel 111 01311015 of the State, and since the
wheel turns we ought to select that part to
which the interest and safety of the State
have directed us.' This clumsy half-meta-
phor he uses several times. He says (Ad
Att. ii. 9) τ ‘⁴ hic orbis rei publicae est con-
versus.'' In the letter to Lentulus (i. 9, ξ
21) he 1135 1110 same kind of argument with
a ship in a storm to illustrate it. The eon-
clusion is 1110 53010 35 11010. You must
look out in matters of State and do the best
that you 030 for yourself.

Garatoni quotes, in illustra-tion of ‘qui
quoniam,⁷ &c., a passage in the Verr. Aet i.
e. 9: “Siculos sane in eo‚'' &c.: see the
note3 and another⁷ Verr. ii. 4, c. 58
(500 1110 note). There is another pas-
sage in the Verr. ii. 4, c. 48 (and the
note), Some people have written labo-
riously on the use of ⁴ qui ’ and 1110 sub-
junctive, which is generally no great diffi-
culty to those who have read Latin authors
with care. A complete examination of
the use of ‘qui’ would be worth a Latin
scholar's labour, and it would remove much
confusion and misunderstanding.

39. qu autem Cn. Pompeiam] The sen-
oence is interrupted‚ and he begins again:

rected, as he calls it, ‘ concedunt‚’and made
it ¹ concedant,' because he thought it more
elegant; and he was confirmed in his
opinion by observing in the next sentence
‘laudibus desim, quas. . .videam.' VVunder's
answer is this, that ‘ quem . . . concedunt’
is merely a definition of ‘eum,' and the
direct form, the indicative is therefore neces-
sary. In the second case ‘ quas . . videam ’
expresses 1110 reason why Cicero cannot fall
short in his respect or duty 10 Caesar.

We have more about Cn. Pompeius and
Cicero's explanation of his present devotion
to him in the In Pison. 0. 31. .

Ο. Caesaris] Having sung briefly the
praises of Cn. Pompeius, he gives Caesar
his turn. He lets us off with a short story
here. But see In Pison. c. 32, and the
note3 De Prov. Cons. c. 8; Pro Balbo, c.
27. Wunder says, ‘ 311 11131 1011111051 10
which Cicero had yielded, was said to have
been stirred up by Caesar's instigation and
help, and accordingly it was supposed that
Cicero would always be Caesar’s enemy.'
There is no doubt that Caesar helped to
drive Cicero out of Rome. Cicero says so'
himself (In Pis. 0. 32). Ι refer again 10
Cicero’s long letter to Lentulus (Ad Div. i.
9) for the explanation of his present policy.

populi Romani . . . judiciis] Manutius
says that this is an allusion to the Lex
Vatinia, by which Caesar got the province
of Gallia Citerior for five years. The allu-
sion to the senate is explained by the ora-
tion De Prov. Cous. 0. ll, where we are
told what the senate granted to Caesar.
