INTRODUCTION. 155

do, for this was a marriage of policy, made only the year before Caesar
set out to the conquest of Gallia. Caesar mentions his father-in-law
Piso in his Commentarii (i. 12), and it is a rare thing for him to go out
of his way to mention any body3 and he speaks of him and his ancestors
in such terms as show that he was not ashamed of him or of them. The
adoption of Clodius into a plebeian family and his election to the tribu-
nate (Be. 59) was also Caesar's work. In B-C. 58, the year of Piso's
and Gabinius⁷ consulate, Cicero was obliged to retire into exile. The
causes of his disgraee are indicated by himself very clearly, if we only
look carefully to what he sayS. Caesar had resolved not to leave Cicero
in Rome when he went into his province (Rc. 58), for he feared that he
would join his old enemies‚ who wished to undo some things which he
had done in his consulate3 and Cicero’s activity and his tongue were
more dangerous than the power of any other of Caesar's enemies. Cae-
sar had secured M. Crassus and Cn. Pompeius, but he had not been
able to secure Cicero during his consulate, though he had tried. In
order to get Cicero away from Rome he offered him the office of legatus
in Gallia, which a Roman consularis might have accepted consistently
with Roman usage. But Cicero was not a soldier, he did not wish to
leave Rome, and he refused Caesar’s offer. Caesar accordingly, if he
did not employ P. Clodius to drive Cicero away, was glad to see him do it ;
and he remained at the gates of the city in the spring of 13.e. 58 till
Cicero had left Rome3 and he then went into Gallia. N either Piso nor
Gabinius would give Cicero any help against Clodius; nor yet his great
friend Cn. Pompeius, on whom he had lavished all the flattery that his
ingenuity could devise or his sels-interest suggest (De Imp. Cn. Pom-
peii). It was a thing settled between Caesar and Pompeius that Cicero
should leave Rome for a time at least: they could hardly hope to keep
him away always, and perhaps did not wish it.

The tribune Clodius rewarded the two consuls by proposing and
carrying a Lex which gave the province of Macedonia to Piso and Syria
to Gabinius, with a large outfit.

Piso and Gabinius went to their provinces at the end of 13.e. 58 or in
the beginning of 13.c. 57. Piso's administration lasted to the year 13.c. 55.
Cicero calls it three yearS, but it was not three complete years. We know
little or nothing of Piso's government except what Cicero tells us ; and it·
he told the truth, Piso was such a villain as even Rome had scldom sent
into her provinces. An attempt was made to supersede Piso and Gabinius
in 13.c. 57, but the intercessio of a tribune prevented it (De Prev. Cous. c.
6). On the fourth of September (13.c. 57) Cicero entered Rome on his re-
turn from exile. In 13.c. 56 Cicero in his speech on the occasiones naming
the consular provinces maintained Caesar-’s title to hold the two (hilline
during the five years for which they had been given to him. Pompeius
