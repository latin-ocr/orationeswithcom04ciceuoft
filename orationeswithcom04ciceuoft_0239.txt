INTRODUOTION. 217

Tullia was severer than the Calpurnia. It forbade the candidates to hire
persons to go about with them. It also seems to have imposed penal-
ties on the ‘ divisores ’ (Pro Plancio, c. 23). No person was allowed to
give an exhibition of gladiators or to feast the people within two years
before he was a candidate (Pro Murena, c. 323 Pro Sestio, c. 64 ; and
In Vatin. c. 15, and the notes), unless 110 was obliged to 0111111111,
gladiators or give a feast under some testamentary disposition. This
corresponds to a clause or clauses about treating in an English act.
This Lex Tullia added to the penalties of the Lex Calpurnia ten years’
exsilium. (Dion Cassius, 37, 0. 29; Pro Murena, c. 41.)

Some critics have asserted that this penalty of exsilium was imposed
on Senators only, a conclusion which is derived from the twenty-third
chapter of the oration Pro Murena3 but the meaning of that chap-
teris not clear, and it has been justly observed that this conclusion
cannot be derived from the words ‘in nostrum ordinem 3’ for Cicero
merely says that the punishment would fall on men of senatorian rank,
and it was only such men who could be candidates for the higher offices,
the Praetorship and the Consulship. From the words ‘poena gravior 111
plebem,’ which occur in the same chapter, it has been infel-red that the
receivers of bribes were punished by the Lex Tullia, or at least the
‘ divisores ² (Rein). It is certain that the ‘divisores ’ were punishable
under some Lex (Pro Plancio, c. 23) ; but I know of no authority for
saying that the receivers of bribes were punished, unless this passage
in the Pro Murena is evidence of it ; and I do not think that it is¹.

There is no proof, as far as I know, that the reccivcr of a bribe at an
election was punished at Rome, and this is an example of the practical
good sense of the Romans. If a man has a vote it is clearly implied
that he may give it as he pleascs, otherwise he could not be said to have
it. If then he gives it to him who pays best, his vote, as 311011,13110
wrongful act, sor 110 has given it to a person to whom he is permitted to
give it. All men who are not legally disqualified may bc candidates3
all are equally eligible. There is no presumption anyway that any cau-
didate is better than another ; all are equally good, for there is no way of
determining who are the best. Even the election of one 111 preference
to another is no proof, nor is it ever taken as proof that the successful
candidate is the better man. It is, however, inconsistent with 1110
nature of a vote that it should be an object of sale, and 110 who offers to
buy what is not saleable‚ and he who sells what 110 knows is notan
object of sale, but of free gift, both of them are mean fellows. But tho
question is this: Is it useful to punish both buyer and 3011011> The

of the heavy and innccurato modern German compilations.
