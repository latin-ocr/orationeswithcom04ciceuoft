166 ORAT. IN L. OALPURNJUM PISONEM

tiorum suorum recordabitur. Meministine, coenum, quum ad te
quinta fere hora cum O. Pisone venissem, nescio quo e gurgustio
te prodire involuto capite soleatuni? et quum isto ore foetido tae-
terrimam nobis popinam inhalassos, excusatione te uti valetudinis,
quod diceres vinolentis te quibusdam medicaminibus solere curari?
quam nos caussam quum accepissennis,--quid enim facere potera-
1nus3—paullisper stetimus in illo ganearum tuarum nidore atque
fumo, unde tu nos quum improbissime respondendo, tum turpis-
sime eructando ejecisti. Idem illo fere biduo productus in con—
tionem ab eo, cui sic aequatum praebebas consulatum tuum, quum ’
esses interrogatus quid sentires de consulatu meo, gravis auctor,
Calatinus credo aliquis, aut Africanus aut Maximus, et non Cae-
soninus Semiplacentinus Oalventius, respondes, altero ad frontem
sublato, altero ad mentum depresso supercilio, crudelitatem tibi
non placere. VII. Hic te ille homo, dignissimus tuis laudibus,
collaudavit. Crudelitatis tu, furcifer, senatum consul in contione
condemnas? non enini me, qui senatui parui ς nam relatio illa salu-
taris et diligens fuerat consulis, animadversio quidem et judicium
senatus. Quae quum reprehendis, ostendis qualis tu, si ita forte
accidisset, fueris illo tempore consul futurus. Stipendio, meher-
cule, et frumento Catilinam esse putasses juvandum. Quid enim

The
man had his slippers on (soleatus), and was
half drunk early in the day. “Stetit
soleatus praetor populi Romani.'' (Verr.
ii. 5, c. 33.) Piso had wrapped his head
up that he might not be known, when he

was to take no medicine, and the other to
drink pure wine. The first rule is un-
doubtedly good for those who can do with-
out physic; and the second rule too is
excellent. If a man will drink wine, let it
be good. Louis Cornaro in his old age,

yuryuslz'um] Some small house.

was visiting a ‘ popina‚’ or eating place and
drinking place.

“ Quaecungue immundis fervent allata po-
ΡΙΠῗΙΖΙοι-εοιέ, Sat. ii. 4, v. 62, and Mac-
leane’s note.)

vinolentis] He had gone in to get a
drink of something. Abrami, who collects
curious things, has cited a passage from
Pliny (xxii. 24), who tells us that Pollio
Romilius, who was then above a hundred
years old. healthy and strong, was asked by
Augustus how he had lived, and his answer
was, “Intus mulso, foris oleo.’' He kept
his inside meist with ‘ mulsum‚’ wine
mixed with honey, and rubbed his skin with
oil. Harduin (note on Pliny) says that
Pollio followed the advice of Democritus,
as we have it recorded by Diophanes
(Geopon. xv. c. 7, and Athenaeus, ii.
46). Abi-ami knew a man who had reached
the same age by observing two rules, one

and he reached near a hundred, made
wine a chief part of his food. Ninon de
l’Enclos is said to have drunk only water3
but she died somewhat short of ninety.
Zaleucus, who legislated for the Locri
Epizephyrii must have made a great mistak-e,
when he punished a man with death who
drank unmixed wine without a physician’s
prescription (Athenaeus, x. 429). Perhaps
drunkenness had become common, and
Zaleucus anticipated the Maine liquor law.

illosere biduo] In the two next days.—
‘ sic aequatum :⁷ these words are unintelli-
gible—⁶ Calatinus :' Atilius Calatinus. See
Vol. iii. Index—⁶ Semiplacentinus? his
grandfather Calventius, his mother's father,
was a Gaul of Placentia. So Piso was Semi-
placentinus. The other half was Roman,
but only halt—⁴ crudelitatem:' he said that
he did not approve of Cicero’s executing

p. the five conspirators. But the senate or-

dered the execution, and Cicero was only
the executioner.
