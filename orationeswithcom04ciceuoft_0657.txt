INTRODUGTION TO THE ELEVENTH PHILIPPIC.

O. TREBONIUS had the province of Asia which the senate gave him after
Caesar’s death. Dolabella had obtained, with the help of M. Antonius,the
province of Syria and a commission to conduct the war against the Par-
thians. He left Italy before the end of Bc 44, in order to reach Syria
before C. Cassius, to whom the province had been assigned by the Dic-
tator Caesar. Cassius had set out for the east before Dolabella. The
route which Dolabella took was through Macedonia, where M. Brutus
was with a force. M. Antonius had given to Dolabella the cavalry which
was in Macedonia; but part of the cavalry deserted the Quaestor Cinna,
when he was leading them through Thessaly, and went over to Brutus.
Another body of cavalry was induced by Cn. Domitius to join Brutus
(Cicero, Phil. x. c. 6). Dolabella had still two legions, one of which he
sent forward into Asia under Octavius Marsus, and he followed himself
in the beginning of B.c. 43.

Trebonius, who was in possession of his province Asia, took precau-
tions against Dolabella and his troops. He gave orders that they should
be provided with all necessaries on their march through Asia to Syria,
but should not be admitted into any strong place. The two Proconsuls
saw one another before Pergamum and before Smyrna, and were on
friendly terms. Dolabella now pretended that he was going to Ephesus
to ship his troops for Syria, to which Trebonius consented. Dolabella
set out for Ephesus, but he hastily turned back in the night, surprised
Smyrna, seized Trebonius and put him to death, in the mouth of Febru—
ary B.c. 43. Cicero is the only writer who speaks of Trebonius being
tortured by Dolabella’s order. Tho fact is exceedingly improbable3 but
as this oration was delivered on the arrival at Rome of the news of Tre-
bonius’ death, it is likely that there were reports of Dolabella‘s cruelty,
and wc may be sure that Cicero would make the most of them. Dola-
bella was dcclared an enemy to the state about the middle of March
ΒΛ). 43.

In this oration Cicero urges the senate to give the prosecution of the
war against Dolabella to O. Cassius, who was in Syria and had a suffi-
cient force. Manutius inferred from the words of Velleius (ii. 62) that
