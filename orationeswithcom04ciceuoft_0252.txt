230 , ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

rem quam est hoc, quod tu metuis ne a populo judicatum esse
videatur. Non enim comitiis judicat semper popuIUS‚ sed movetur
plerumque gratia, cedit precibus; facit eos a quibus est maxime
ambitus3 denique etiam si judicat, non dilectu aliquo aut sapi-
entia ducitur ad judicandum, sed inipetu nonnumquam et quadam
etiam temeritate. Non est enim consilium in vulgo, non ratio, non
discrimen, non diligentia; semperque sapientes ea quae populus
fecisset ferenda, non semper laudanda duxerunt. Quare quum te
aedilem fieri oportuisse dicis, populi culpam, non competitoris ace
cusas. Ut fueris dignior quam Plancius—de quo ipso ita tecum
contendam paullo post ut conservem dignitatem tuam—sed ut fueris
dignior, non competitor a quo es victus, sed populus, a quo es prae-
teritus, in culpa est. In quo illud primum debes putare, comitiis
praesertim aediliciis studium esse populi, non judicium3 eblandita
illa, non enucleata esse suffragia3 eos qui suffragium ferant, quid
cuique ipsi debeant, considerare saepius quam quid cuique a re
publica videatur deberi. Sin autem mavis esse judicium, non tibi
id rescindendum est, sed ferendum. Male judicavit populus—'At
judicavit.——Non debuit—At potuit.—Non fera—At multi claris-
simi et sapientissimi cives tulerunt. Est enim haec conditio libe-
rorum populorum, praecipueque hujus principis populi et omnium

4. maxime ambitus] Cicero could say
this about elections, and all that follows,
because it serv-ed his purpose. If he had
been addressing the Quirites, he could have
put a different colour on the matter. Here
he tells the truth. The voters must be

would express particular facts. So he says,
0. 27, “ qui venissent ad aquas,’' ‘ the com-
pany at the bath.’—‘ culpam . . . accusas ι’
a rare expression, as Wunder remarks.
‘ Culpa’ occurs in Pro Rabirio Post. c. 2

in this sense, ‘¹ res quae ponitur in culpa.'’

solicited : they like it. If they do not want
money for their votes, they must have the
respect which power always exacts, a per-
sonal visit, a shake of the hand, the abasc-
ment of the candidate to their own level, if
it is only for five minutes every year, or
even every seven years. He who would se-
cure his election must go through this
humiliation. One hardly knows whether
the candidate is more worthy of pity or the
elector of contempt.

non diliyentia] The sense of ⁴ diligentia ’
may be got by comparing it with ¹dileetu‚¹
or ⁶ delectu,' as WVunder writes it. Cicero
first uses ‘discrimem' which we may render
by ‘ discrimination,' another form of the
same word. From ‘discrimination’ comes
‘ selecti011.’—‘ ea quae populus fecisset ’ is
a Roman way of expressing ¹ the acts of the
people,' or ‘what the people do;' and as
Cicero is expressing himself generally, and
not referring to any particular acts, hc
avoids the use of the indicative, which

(Quint. xi. l, 81.)

eblandita] ‘ Those are votes got by
coaxing‚' by flattery, persuasion, and fair
words. He adds they are not ‘enucleata
suffragia,’ votes got out of their husk and
covering, like the fruit of a nut, or any
thing of that kind ; not the real genuine in-
side of the thing.——‘ videatur deberi ε’ ‘ de-
beatur,' Baiter.

Sin maris] Orelli says, There are
those who tell us that ‘ sin ² is not used, un-
less ‘si' has been used in some clause
which precedes the clause beginning with
⁴ sin ς’ but this passage shows that they are
mistaken. Wunder observes that nobody
now teaches this, but he adds that the
clause which precedes the clause beginning
with ‘ sin‚' ifit does not contain ⁴ si,’ should
however express something which stands in
opposition to that which is expressed by
‘sin’ and the words which follow ⁴ sin,'
which is the case herc, and wherever ⁴ sin '
is used. (See 0. 6, “ Sin hoc '¹ &c.)
