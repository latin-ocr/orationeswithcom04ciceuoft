nullam tam pravae sententiae caussam reperietis. Vos vero, patres
conscripti, conservate auctoritatem vestram, manet-e in sententia,
tenete vestra memoria, quod saepe ostendistis, hujus totius belli
in unius viri fortissimi et maximi vita positum esse discrimen.

sense which it has here—⁴ eventui :’

2. sortitu] There are ‘sortitu’ and
¹ sortit0,' as there are ‘ fortuito ² and ‘for-
tuitu.‘ It was determined by lot that Hir-
tius should go to Mutina first. Graevius
remarks that Manutius and Muretus kept
the common reading ‘ consules sortiti: ad

bellum profectus,' &c.

quum exercitu . . . liberasset] a b t v
have ‘cum (eum v) primis pestibus ;' i has ⁶ a
primis pestibus ;' ⁴ tum primis pestibus ’ Fer-
rarius; ‘⁴ at videtur gravius vulnus latere,
fort. compressis pestibus '’ (Halm). Manu-
tius supposes that the ‘primae pestes' is
Antonius’ return from Brundisium.

dolorem . . . (Imnesliczmnj Caesar’s sor-
row for his great uncle's murder. Cicero
caus it ⁴ aliquem‚' which is difficult to render
in such a way as to express the meaning.
But caesar felt more than Cir-ero supposed,
or he pretended that 110 felt the wrong done
to the Dictator, and he soon let the Romans
know it.

necessitati victus] Ι am not sure what-
he means. There may have been a dearth,
and provisions may have been dear. The
treasury was ill provided with money, and
the Ludi could not be celebrated in the
usual way (Dion 4⁴3, c. 31).

inihi] ⁸ Quod sperare ' refers to ‘ut D.
Brutus liberaretur! ‘Inibi’ means, says
Ferrarius, that which is not yet done, but is
very near being done. ⁸ Inibi' occurs in

liipipvye, c.3): δι’ εὐτυχιην, ἣν συμπάσης
ἐγὼ τῆς ἐν ἀνθρώποις οὔσης ‹unvai-ryme
καὶ σοφίας ὁρῶ κρατοῦσαν. 110 has 1110
same again in the Second Olynthiac (ξ 22 ‚
where he says that in all human affairs the
power of fortune to turn the scale is great,
or rather it is every thing; and he has the
strange remark that he would still preter
the fortune of Athens, if 1110 people were
only willing to do what they ought, to king
Philip's fortune3 for 110 sees that Athens
has much better means of securing the
favour of the gods than Philip has. 1 don't
quote this because 1 suppose that Cicero
borrowed what 110 says. lle is using the
common language of mankind, and we 111110
