and probably not the true reason. He tells Trebonius (Ad Div. x. 28)
that sometimes he can hardly help being angry with him for saving the
life of this pcstilent fellow Antonius. Though Cicero was not an accom-
plice in the assassination, 116 was an accessory after the fact. He gave
his approbation to the murderers ς 116 praised them in his speeches and in
his letters3 and 116 showed his zeal and his judgment too, in wishing that
the conspirators had killed at least one man more. This one man spoiled
all their work. A few words about M. Antonius, Cicero’s new adver-
sary, will help to explain the remainder of Cicero's orations3 for the
rest of Cicero's life was a struggle against Antonius.

M. Antonius was the grandson of the great orator M. Antonius, who
was murdered (13.0. 87) by the order of 0. Marius. The elder son of
the orator was also named M. Antonius, and he was the father of M.
Antonius, consul Β.0. 44. This M. Antonius the son, surnamed Cre-
ticus, was Propraetor in B.O. 74, with very large powers against the
pirates. He abused his authority by plundering and robbing, and he
disgraced the arms of Rome by his incapacity (Verr. ii. 6. 3 ; iii. c. 91).
The orator had another son, 0. Antonius, Cicero's colleague in the con-
sulship (Rc. (53), a man who was as bad as his brother. The mother of
the youngest M. Antonius was J ulia, a daughter of L. Julius Caesar.
After the death of Antonius Creticus, J ulia married P. Lentulus Sura,
who was one of Catilina’s fellow-conspirators. Lentulus was put to
death for his treason (13.0. 63) by order of the senate, and Cicero, the
consul, looked after the execution3 a circumstance which may have been
one cause of his stepson's enmity to Cicero. Antonius was fond of
pleasure, and we may believe that he was a dissolute young man without
accepting as true all Cicero’s abuse of him. One of his favourite com-
panions was 0. Scribonius Curio, the most prodigal young man in Rome.
Antonius was also for a time a friend of P. Clodius, and supported him
in his tribunesbip, Ro. 58. From some cause this union did not last
long, and Antonius retired to Greece. But he had a love for a military
life, and was active and restless. In Β.0. 57 A. Gabinius invited Anto-
nius to his government of Syria, and gave him the command of his
cavalry. Antonius accompanied Gabinius (Rc. 55) in his expedition 10
Egypt, for the purpose of restoring Ptolemaeus Auletes to his throne.
He showed great military talent and resolution in this affair, and his
good humour and jovial character pleased the citizens of Alexandria.

On his return from the east Antonius went to Caesar in Gallia in
nc. 54 or early in nc. 53 (Phil. ii. c. 19); but he returned to Rome in
Ro. 53, to be a candidate for the quaestorship, and with letters of 16-
commendation from Caesar 10 Cicero. In Β.0. 52 Antonius was quaestor,
and 116 returned 10 Caesar, who speaks of him as being with him at the
siege of Alesia (B. G. vii. 81), and as being left in command of the
