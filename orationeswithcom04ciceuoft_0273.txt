non tulerunt, quum ex cxxv judicibus, principibus equestris ordinis,
quinque et Lxx reus rejiceret, L referret, omniaque potius permis-
’ cuerunt quam ei legi conditionique parerent ; nos neque ex delectis
judicibus, sed ex omni populo, neque editos ad rejiciendum, sed ab
accusatore constitutos judices ita feremus ut neminem rejiciamus?
Neque ego nunc legis iniquitatem queror, sed factum tuum a sen-
tentia legis doceo discrepare; et illud acerbum judicium, si, quemad-
modum senatus censuit populusque jussit, ita fecisses, ut huic et
suam et ab hoc observatas tribus ederes, non modo non quererer,
sed hunc iis judicibus editis qui idem testes esse possent absolutum
putarem 3 neque nunc multo secus existimo. Quum enim has
tribus edidisti, ignotis te judicibus uti malle quam notis judicavisti:
fugisti sententiam legis; aequitatem omnem rejecisti3 in tenebris
quam in luce caussam versari maluisti. Voltinia tribus ab hoc cor-

were in some way chosen by the prosecutor

&Vunder (500 1110 Introduction to this ora· out of the Delecti‚ and yet more than half

tion) says that ‘editicii judices' are those could be challenged. But even this was

“qui ab accusatore ita sunt constituti ut
nemo eorum rejici ab reo possit; quam
contra editi dicuntur, qui sunt ab accusa-
tore delecti ita ut rejici ab reo possint.'’
And 110 quotes cc. 15, 16, and this passage
(c. 17) to prove 1115 assertion. The passage
in the Murena, c. ⁶23, refers to the same
proposal as this: “idem editicios judices
esse voluisti ut odia occulta,'’ &c.; and in
the note on that passage I have adopted
Wunder’s explanation, for it was not my
business then to investigate this matter.
Servius (Ad Virg. Eclog. iii. 50) has “Con-
sentio etiam ad editicium judicem ι Editicius
autem judex est quem una pars eligit;”
and then 110 quotes Cicero, “ Neque enim
quidquam aliud . . . sequutus ” (c.l5). But
Servius' definition is worth nothing here, for
he means that one party shall propose, and
the other shall consent.

That the prosecutor should in any case
name the jury is a fact which cannot be
proved, is highly improbable, and contrary
to Roman principle: “Neminem majores
nostri non modo de existimatione cujus-
quam, sed 110 pecuniari quidem de re
minima esse judicem, nisi qui inter adver·
sarios convenisset '' (Pro Cluentio, c. 43). If
the prosecutor took the J udices out ot* the
Album, that does not prove that he selected
them. If we admit that the purpose of this
Lex, to which Cicero alludes, was to enable
the prosecutor to 0110050 cxxv out of the
Delecti judicos, and the defendant to reject
more than half of them, this proves that
⁴ editicii judices ' might be so called, if they

resisted, as Cicero tells us. What did the
Licinia? Did it enable the prosecutor to
name the Judices out of the three ‘ tribus ἓ ’
Certainly not. Cicero never says any thing
stronger than ‘has tribus edidistis where
110 is using precise words.

sententia leyis] Wunder admits that
Cicero is not telling the truth. There was
nothing of the kind in the Lex (see c. 16,
note). Yet hc here says, ‘⁴ quemadmodum
senatus censuit populusque jussit,'' which,
if taken in the plain sense of the words,
means that the jury was not constituted as
the Lex required. But it was, or Plancius
could not have been tried. In the words
‘ quemadmodum senatus censuit’ the fallacy
lies, sor it cannot be in ‘populus jussit,’
which is only another name for the Lex.

neque nnnc multo secus] He. expects
Plancius to be acquitted. This oration was
revised after it was delivered, and of course
contained this passage, in which Cicero ex-
presses his opinion that Plancius will be
acquitted. But 1 do not see that any
probable conclusion as to the result of the
trial can be derived from it.—⁴ignotis:’
Judices who knew nothing of the facts.
for these ¹ tribus' were not charged with
being corrupted. The orator complains of
‘ignoti judices' being selected; but his·
complaint is ridiculous. The best jury is
composed of honest men, who know nontin-‚z
of the mat-ter on which they have to ὤν’·
their judgment, except what. they henr
srom the evidence.
