nostrae tempora postulabant, et clarissimos viros esse vidimus, et

hodie esse volumus quam plurimos gratiosos.

volumus . . . yratz‘osos] “ Volumus
T. E.‚ videmus Ore11i‚” Baiter. Wunder,
who has ‘ videmus,' gives no authority for
it, nor does he mention ‘volumus’ as the
reading of B„ which is Baiter’s T. Wunder
objects to the word ‘ gratiosos3’ and there
seems some reason in his objections if we
read ‘ videmus.’

Decurtatio] We may conjecture what
this means. Literally ‘decuriare' means
to distribute people into tens, but there is
no occasion to assume that Cicero means
exactly tens. XVunder supposes that a
‘decurio’ was placed over each ⁴ decurias
and that his business was to make the men
of his ⁴ decurio' vote as he pleased, andin
favour of his employer. He admits that
‘decurio' is never used in this sense, but
he has no doubt that those who were
called Sodales are those whom he has
named Decuriones. This is all guess, and
bad guessing. The voters of a ‘ tribus’ were
divided into companies, and probably some
man looked after the votes of each com-
pany. By distributing them into small
bodies under a manager‚ it might be more
easy to find out how they voted, for each
of the members would watch his neigh-
bour. We cannot conjecture how the vote
of each member would be ascertained, as
the vote was by ballot3 but this division
into ‘decuriae' was partly made, we may
assume, to give the members of the ‘de-
curiae' the opportunity of watching one an-
other at the ballot as well as they could.
If each voter had a set of voting tablets
given to him at the polling place, he would
use only those which he put into the box;
and it' he were allowed to retain the rest,
he might be required to produce them to
his captain in order to gire some kind of
evidence that he had done his duty. The
remedy for this would be to require the
veter, after he had deposited his ballot,
to throw the tablets which he did not use
into a waste box at the hustings.

Wunder supposes ⁴ descriptio populi’ to
be a like division into classes of the rest of
the pcople who did not belong to the can-
didate's tribe, and that captains were set
over them to work as in the matter of the
‘decuriae.’ Ι do not accept this explanation.

There is great difficulty 111 ascertaining
the Roman way of voting. A letter of
Cicero (Ad Att. i. 1⁴) scenis to show that
at the voting sor a ch two voting tablets
were given to each veter, one of which

Deeuriatio tribulium,

tablets was marked with A. (antiquo), and
the other with U. R. (uti rogas). Wunder
remarks (Var. Lect. p. cxlviii) that it is the
common opinion that the practice was the
same in voting for the Magistratus3 but he
observes that there is no evidence to prove
this, and that there is evidence against it.
He quotes a passage of Suetonius (Caesar,
c. 80) as evidence that on the occasion there
mentioned tho citizens themselves wrote
the names of the candidates on the ‘tabellae.'
He also quotes a passage from Plutarch
(Cato Min. c. 46), where it is said that
Cato discovered fraud at the voting by ob-
serving that all the tablets were in one
handwriting. The commentators do not.
agree about the meaning of this passage,
but qunder concludes that the passage
proves that each citizen was required to
write his own ‘tabella ¹ at the election for
magistrates. But we may rejoin that
Plutarch may have misunderstood the mat-
ter3 and secondly, what must a voter do
who could not write? For we shall not
readily admit that every voter could write.
Again‚ he quotes a passage of Pliny (Epp.
iv. 25), where he is speaking of 1110 vote by
ballot at an election. Pliny says: “At
the last comitia on some ot' the 10111111,ν
tablets there were written many laughable
and some obscene words; on one tablet, 111
place of the names of the candidates. names
of voters were found.'' But the practice in
Pliny's time may not have been the same
as in Cicero's time. These tablets with
obscene words on them may have been
thrown in by voters, instead of the propcr
tablets. Some wag certainly put in 1110
one tablet with voters' names on it, instead
of the candidates’. What did the Romans
care about voting in Pliny’s time ? Wun-
der’s remark is worth reading: ⁸⁴ Do you
suppose that such tablets, with merry and
obscene words on them, were given to 1110
people by those whose duty it was to prc-
sent the voting tablets to them ?’' No, we
shall not suppose that, when there is an
easier explanation. We may assent to one
conclusion from this passage, that the
names of the candidates sor whom the 1100-
ple voted were written on one tablet 111
Pliny’s time, and that the peoplc wrote 011 a
tablet, which was presented to them at 1111-
voting place, for it is agreed that the votius:
tablets were supplied to the pcople. But
what a heap of confusion thr-rc would bc is
the voters wrote the names at 1110 pulling
