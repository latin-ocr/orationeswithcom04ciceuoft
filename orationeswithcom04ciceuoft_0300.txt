‘278 ORAT. PRO CN. PLANCIO

quidem veste mutata; quod pro mc uno post hominum memoriam
publico consilio susceptum est. Sed recordare qui tum fuerint
consulum nomine hostes, qui soli in hac urbe senatum senatui
parere non sirint, edict-oque suo non luctum patribus conscriptis,
sed indicia luctus ademerint. At erat mecum cunctus equester
ordo3 quem quidem in contionibus saltator ille Catilinae consul
proscriptionis denuntiatione terrebat. At tota Italia convenerat;
cui quidem belli intestini et vastitatis metus inferebatur. ⁸

XXXVI. Hisce ego auxiliis studentibus atque incitatis uti me,
Laterensis, potuisse confiteor 3 sed erat non jure, non legibus, non
disceptando decertandum: nam profecto, praesertim tam bona in
caussa, numquam, quo ceteri saepe abundarunt, id mihi ipsi auxilium
meum defuisset: armis fuit, armis, inquam, fuit dimicandum, quibus
a servis atque a servorum ducibus caedem fieri senatus et bonorum
rei publicae exitiosum fuisset. Vinci autem improbos a bonis
fateor fuisso praeclarum, si finem tum vincendi viderem: [quem

cum autem conjunctio, t acciperet ;'' in the
palimpsests also, Wunder says,›‘ at ' is very
often written ⁴ ad.' So in the De Republica,
ed. Mai, i. c. 9, we have ‘adqui’ in the
MSS. for ‘atqui3' and 111 1. 0. 16 there is
⁴ adque’ twice for ⁴ atqua—⁴ erat mecum :⁹
that no one may find a difficulty in this ex-
pression Wunder quotes Pro C. Rabirio,
c. 8, ‘⁴ ut aut cum Saturnino esset aut cum
bonis;'’ and Philipp. viii. c. 11. After these
three passages, ‘At erat mecum senatus,'
‘At erat mecum cunctus equester ord0,'
‘At tota Italia,' we have respectively ‘ et
quidem,’ ‘quem quidem,’ ‘cui quidem.'
The three clauses beginning with ‘ At ’ are
111 1110 11311110 of 311 objection by Laterensis,
of 311 argument why Cicero should have
stayed at Rome. ‘ But you had the senate
on your side,’ ‘But all the equestrian
class was with y0u‚’ and so 01¹3 to which
Cicero replies severally: ‘ Yes, and in
mourning;’ ‘Yes‚ the equites who were
threatened vm'th proscription3' ‘ Yes, all
Italy, which was terrified with the prospect
of civil war and devastation:' all which
were reasons for not staying at Rome and
fighting it out.

veste mutata] The senate put on the
dress of mourning in the time of Cicero's
peril, but the consuls would not allow it

tio, c. 19).—‘sirint:' Wunder’s ortho-
graphy. The various past tenses of this
verb · 5111010 ’ were often contracted. Wun-

der refers to ‘sissent‚' Pro Sestio, c. 19,
and to many other examples. Ernesti wrote
¹ siverunt . . . ademerunt,’ because he takes
these words to express the judgment of
Cicero. They do express it, but notin that
direct form which requires the indicative.
The 0111105, as usual, speak of ‘ qui’ being

explaining it 35 they ought to do.

saltator] Gabinius. In the In Pis. c. 8
Gabinius is a ‘ saltatrix tonsa! See also
In Pis. 0. 10. Ernesti would erase ‘Cati-
linae‚’ but this style of criticism is contrary
to good sense. The word is intelligible and
has 3 meaning, which the Schol. Ambros.
saw, and his note is a proof of the high anti-
quity of the reading. WVunder refers to a
like expression Iu Pis. 0. 9: “cum altero
Catilinae lanternario consule.”

Garatoni refers to In Pis. c. 9: “Quasi

He refers 10 1110 same writer for an explana-
tion of ‘ si . . viderem,' where the ‘tirones ’
would have expected ⁴ si . . vidissem.’ He
also refers to this oration, 0. 20, “neque
enim . . nisi viderent ;'’ and to two exam-
ples from the spurious orations. In the De
Senect. 0. 23 there is ‘tanta esse conatos
