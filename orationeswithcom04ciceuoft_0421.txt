INTRODUGTION. 399

Caesar, who took him prisoner and let him go 3 but he was now punished
for his perjury and perfidy in joining the Pompeian party again (Bell.
Afric. c. 64).

While Q. Ligarius was in exile Cicero wrote to him (Ad Div. vi. 13,
14) and informed him of the efforts which he and Ligarius’ brothers were
making to obtain his pardon. In one of these letters Cicero speaks of
a. visit which he had paid to Caesar one morning, at the request of Li-
garius’ brothers, and of the indignity and trouble that he put up with in
getting access to Caesar. At this interview Ligarius’ brothers and kins-
men were at Caesar's feet, while Cicero spoke. Though Caesar did not
expressly pardon Ligarius on this occasion, Cicero conjectured that he
was well inclined to do it. Q. Tubero however interposed by making a
formal charge against Ligarius, the nature of which we only know so far
as we can learn from this oration, from Quintilian (c. 3, and the note),
and from the words of Pomponius, who says of Ligarius, “ Is est Q.
Ligarius, qui quum Africae oram teneret, infirmum Tuberonem applicare
non permisit nec aquam haurire, quo nomine eum accusavit (Tubero) et
Cicero defendit.’' This would certainly be no ground for a formal pro-
secution, nor have we any reason for believing that this charge of
Tubero was such. Halm assumes that a jurist like Tubero must have
made a definite charge founded on some Lex, in order to appear as an ac-
cusator before Caesar in the Forum. He explains the words ‘ quo nomine '
of Pomponius as meaning no more than the mot-ive or occasion of Tubero's
prosecution of Ligarius, But we must observe that Pomponius says “it
was for this that Tubero charged him, and Cicero defended him.‘' Pom-
ponius may not have stated the true ground of Tubero’s charge, but this
is the ground that he does state, and no other. It is plain however
that such a charge was no ground for a legal prosecution.

Halm conjectures, with the help of the passage in Quintilian (xi. 1,
80) in which Tubero's charge is stated (“ Ligarium . . . pro J uba atque
Afris inimicissimis populo Romano stetisse,'’ c. 3. of this oration, aud
the note), that the Accusatio was a charge of Perduellio, or in the nar-
rower sense, Proditio, betrayal of the fatherland to the enemy. The
case was heard before Caesar, then Dictator, and in the Forum, as
Sulla when Dictator had sat in judgmont (c. 4). This passage he says
(c. 4) also shows clearly that Caesar sat in judgment in no other capa-
city than that of “Dictator rei publicae constituendae :” it contains
also, he says, a reproach to the prosecutor, that he wished to use the
revived dictatoria] power for an odious purpose. Thus too it becomes
clear why the matter was heard in the Forum, and before Caesar alone ;
and there would bc the more reason for this being so, if at this timc-
therc was no special Praetor for cases of Majestas, according to the Lex
