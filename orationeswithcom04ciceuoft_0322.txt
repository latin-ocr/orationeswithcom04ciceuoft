300 ORAT. PRO O. RABIRIO POSTUMO

CATAM Pecuniam (τΕΡιεειῡΤ, aperte equites Romani restiterunt.
Quid, hoc licere volebant? Minime, neque solum hoc genus pc-

putabant—sed hanc vitam quietam atque otiosam secuti sumus,
quae quoniam honore caret, careat etiam molestia.——Ta1n es tu

the MSS. reading ‘unam‚’ and Halm ac-
cepts it. ‘Novam' is a very probable correc-
tion. At the time when Drusus proposed to
make the Equites liable to be tried for taking
a bribe as Judices, they were the only Ordo
out of which the Judices were taken, pur-
suant to the Lex Sempronia.

The MSS. have ⁴ judicatam.' Patricius
proposed ‘judicandam,’ which Halm has,
and he refers to Verr. Acti. c. 13. Com-
pare also Ad Att. i. 17: “promulgatum
ex senatusconsulto fuisse ut de iis qui ob
judicandum pecuniam accepissent quaere-
retur.'’ The Equites did not like this, he
sa s.

§le-qima] Patricius,followed by Halm, adds
‘ iis ' after ‘ legibus ;' and he prefixes ‘Te ’
to the address‚ ‘ Delectat amplissimus,'
&c. The conjecture is ingenious, but not
necessary, Ι think. The Equites are sup-
posed to say to the senators τ ⁴ The highest
rank in the State, and all these fine things
are very pleasant, but we prefer going with-
out them and not being subject to the
dangers which they may bring)

ad . . ἷρνοᾶὶία] Lambinus says that
some critics think we should read ‘ pro-
dendam.' Compare Verr. ii. 5, 0. 14, and
the note. Mommsen alters the MSS. read-
ing ‘Est simul’ into ⁴ Sit simul ;' and Halm

Si jam vobis nuntiaretur in senatu sententias diei ut

Si lex

Vos senatus liberos hac lege esse

prints it. Patricius proposes ‘ Esto simuL'
which is better.

major] “majorum codd.; Corr. Hoto-
manus‚¹' Halm 3 but Halm has made some
mistake. Hotmann says “ sollicitudo atque
molestia, nimirum ob majorum judiciorum
pericula . . . (majorum enim lego non
major->3⁷

Tam es tu, dcx] This is the reply of the
Senator. The Eques rejoins that he is
made a Judex against bis will, and there-
fore should not be subjected to the same
penalties as those who voluntarily seek
place and power. Patricius proposes to
omit ¹ Senator,’ and Halm does it; or Pa-
tricius would write ‘Tam es tu judex eques,
quam ego Senator.’ The meaning is ⁴ You
are a Judex as much as I am a Senator;’
and therefore you should be liable as Ju-
deX. Manutius explains it right.

leqem . . . timere] Here again Halm
follows Patricius, who writes ‘ aut lege
senatoria non teneri) Antonius Augustinus
proposes to read ⁴ aut legem senatoriam non
ti1ne1·e‚' which is in one of Muretus’ MSS.
The ⁴ lege senatoria' was Drusus’ attempt
to bring the Equites within the penalties
of a Lex, which it was contended by the
Equites did not apply to them.

si lex ferretur] Mommsen writes ‘si
