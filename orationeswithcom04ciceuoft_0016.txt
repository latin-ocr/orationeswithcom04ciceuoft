x PREFAOE.

a defunct, lifeless body. To reanimate it, to show all the propor—
tions of this noble structure, is the business of the teacher. He
should read over the whole to his class in the best language that
he can find, and he should do it, if the thing is short, at· a sitting;
and if it is long, he should do it in as few sittings as he can. He
need not trouble himself about parts that are corrupt, or so diffieult
as to be almost unintelligible : he may pass over such things lightly.
His object is to let the student see what the thing is altogether3
and if it is a work of genius and art, genius and art will show them-
selves by being presented in their entire and simple beauty ⁴. It is
not an easy thing for a teacher to do well what Ι have suggested.
Some will do it better than others; but I believe that all who have
competent knowledge will with a little practice do it well enough
to please their hearers, and be pleased themselves too with the
profit which they will get. As to the students, Ι suppose out of a
class of twenty a few would not attend very much, no more than
they attend to their usual Iessons; bnt a great many will attend
carefully, and will be pleased and instructed. Having often made
the experiment, I can speak with confidence of its success.

I said a few words in the Preface to the first volume about the
Notes. There are two ways of making notes, and perhaps 1nore;
but I have only to deal with two here. No commentator can ne-
glect to look at what has been done by others. He may either
read all that has ever been said about his author or the greater
part, and make a selection from the commentators' notes: or he
may study his author carefully, mark the difficulties, make his own
notes, and then improve and correct them by the aid of what others
have done. This second way is that which I have followed, and I
think it is the best. If an editor follows this method, his work will
contain a great deal of his own, either good or bad. A man who
has not sufficient confidence in himself to think that he can do some-
thing for the explanation of an author by his own labour, had better
let the thing alone. He who only reads what others have said, is
likely to read too much and to write too much, and there is great
risk that he will be eneumbered by the mass of matter which he
collectS. His own judgment will not be so clear as it ought to be,
