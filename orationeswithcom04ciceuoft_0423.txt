INTRODUOTION. 401

as guilty of Majestas, by Caesar or his flatterers. But whether this
stubborn resistance was 6ο considered or not, there was no trial for
Majestas or any thing else in the case of Ligarius.

This speech was delivered in Be. 46, and before Caesar set out to
Spain on his last campaign. Ligarius was pardoned, and like many
others 116 repaid Caesar's generosity by becoming one of his assassins.
11 was Caesar’s fortune to get the victory over all his 6116111166, and to
perish by the hands of those whom he thought that 116 had made his
friends. The dictator Sulla spared no enemy, and 116 died a natural
death. Ligarius himself got his desei-ts, if he was one of the two bro-
thers Ligarii who perished in the proscriptions of the Triumviri (Appian,
B. C. iv. 22). Appian (iv. 23) mentions another Ligarius who perished
also, but he does not describe him as a brother.

This speech belongs to that class of orations which were included
under the term Deprecatio, and this is the only example of the kind
among Cicero’s speeches There is a definition of Deprecatio by the
Auctor ad Herennium (i. c. 14) ; “Deprecatio est, quum et peccasse se
et consulto fecisse reus confitetur, 61 tamen postulat ut sui misereantur.
Hoc in judicio non fere potest usu venire, nisi &a Ergo in judicium
non venit3 at in Senatum, aut ante imperatorem et in consilium talis
caussa potest venire.’' Quintilian also (v. 13, 5) has some remarks on
Deprecatio. (See also this oration, c. 10 11016.)

Τ1116 speech was circulated in writing by the copies which Atticus’
Librarii made of it. Balbus and Oppius admired it, and they sent
Caesar a copy when he was in Spain, 13.e. 45 (Ad Att. xiii. 12 and 19).
It seems that we have the speech in the form in which it was delivered,
for Cicero says that he would not add any thing that might offend
Tubero, who was extremely apt to take offence (Ad Att. xiii. 20).
Drumann remarks that in this speech Cicero preserved the dignity and
freedom of a republican, and showed also the tact and cautious reservo
osa courtier. The case indeed was not easy to handle, and if Caesar
had not been genereus and fearless, ready to pardon a man who might
still remain his enemy, like the other Ligarius whom he had punished
sor his baseness, the orator with all his skill might have pleaded 111 vain.
Cicero’s republican frcedom however is only false appearance. It was
flattery under the guise of free speaking. Drumann also observes that
Wolf has not attached the genuineness of this speeeh; an observation
which has as little sense in it as if 116 had said that Wolf had not
attacked the genuineness of all the speeches This at least is safe from
suspicion. It is in its kind a. perfect composition.
