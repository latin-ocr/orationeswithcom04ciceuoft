534 INTRODUOTION

Caesar's arrangements‚ and consequently his title to the province (p.
456). Brutus (leclared by an edict that he would hold Gallia Cisalpina
on the behalf of the senate, and this edict was read at Rome on the
20th of December (Phil. iii. c. 43 iv. 3). The war now began and
Brutus shut himself up in Mutina, where Antonius besieged him till the
middle of April Ro. 43.

In the month of October, as it has been said, Caesar had gone into
Campania to the colonies of the Dictator to raise troops. The old sol-
diers were ready to support one who professed that he would avenge the
Dictator’s death and maintain all his measures against his assassins.
The enemies of Antonius were ready to believe that Caesar would sup-
port the republic, and regard his duty to it more than his obligation to
avenge the Dictator’s death. Cicero was either deceived by Caesar, or
he hoped to make use of him against Antonius, in the expectation that
it would not be difficult to deal with this youth, when Antonius was out
of the way. He certainly encouraged the youth in his bold and illegal
measureS. At least he says so himself.

Caesar raised troops among the veterans of Casilinum and Calatia
and other Campaniam colonies. He paid them 500 denarii apiece (Ad
Att. xvi. 8) 3 and following Cicero's advice, took them to Rome before
Antonius returned from Brundisium. The tribune Ti. Canutius, An-
tonius’ enemy, went to meet Caesar, and he comforted the people, who
were frightened at the approach of the troops, with the assurance that
Caesar had come to protect Rome. When he entered the city Caesar
addressed the people, and Cicero who was still in the country was
alarmed at his speech, a copy of which was sent to him. The youth
swears ‘ so true as he hopes to attain to his father's honours ;’ and at
the same time ‘ he stretched out his right hand towards Caesar's statue.’
‘ May I never owe my safety to such a person,' adds Cicero (Ad Att.
xvi. 15). The soldiers whom Caesar had led to Rome, were not pleased
to find that they were to oppose Antonius and their old comrades 111
arms. Some complained that they were deceived, and others pretended
that- they wanted to go home for their arms, though it is not likely that
soldiers had come so far without them. Caesar behaved prudently. He
thanked them for what they had done, and let those go who wished.
Those who stayed with him he led into Etruria, and made Arretium the
place of meeting for all the men whom he raised in the north of Italy.
Some of the men who left him came back, preferring military service
to the labour of the fields (Appian, B. C. iii. 6. 42).

During this time the Macedonian legions were advancing from Brun-
disium3 and the Martia, which was at Alba near Rome, declared for
Caesar. This defection, as already observed, was followed by the revolt
of the Quarta. These two legions joined Caesar in Etruria. All Caesar's
