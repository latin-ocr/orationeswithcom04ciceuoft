proinde quasi exitus rerum, non hominum consilia legibus vindi-
centur. Minus dolendum fuit re non perfecta, sed puniendum certe
nihilo minus. Quoties ego ipse, judiees, ex P. Clodii telis et ex
cruentis ejus manibus effugi, ex quibus si me non vel mea vel rei
publicae fortuna servasset, quis tandem de interitu meo quaestionem
tulisset? VIII. Sed stulti sumus qui Drusum, qui Africanum,
Pompeium, nosmetipsos cum P. Clodio conferre audeamus. Tolera-
bilia fuerunt illa: P. Clodii mortem aequo animo nemo ferre potest.

(48. 8. 14) the doctrine is laid down: “in
maleficiis voluntas spectatur non exitus,’'
which is a rescript of Hadrian. Another
rescript of Hadrian (48. 8. 1, ξ 3) is this:
“qui hominem non occiderit, sed vul-
neraverit ut occidat, pro homicida dam-
nandum.'’ This is a sound principle. The
guilt of the assassin does not depend on
the event, but on the intention (voluntas).
Intention alone is not puuishable, because
it cannot be proved; but if it could be
proved, the intention should be punished.
The intention is best proved by the act,
and the manner of doing the act. The act
alone does not prove the intention3 but he
who kills is under the obligation of show-
ing that it was not his intention to kill.
When the intention is proved, and the in-
tention becomes act, the attempt to kill
ought to be punished as it would be
pnnished if death were the consequence.
Our law does not accept this principle. It
seems as if we were particularly concerned
to sparo men who intended to kill, and
cared little for those whose lives wcrc
attempted. Attempts to murder by at-
tempting to administer poison, or by
shooting, or attempting to drown, suffocate,
or stranglc any person, although no bodily
injury is 011“0010(1 (7 Win. IV. and l Vict.
c. 85) are punishablo with transportation

and 11115505, he lias the benetit of the ac-
cident. Other cases of shooting and wound-
ing with intent to do grievous bodily harm
are also punishable with transportation or
imprisonment. Accordingly, a inan may
shoot or stab another, and a jury may tind
that the intention is only to do grievous
bodily harm, when everybody sees plainly
that the intention was to kill. Cicero is
right. It is the intention that we punish,
or should punish, not the act. ‘There is
less cause for sorrow, if the act is not
accomplished, bnt certainly the intention
should be punished all 1110 same,’ as he
says ς and he says it well.

8. afflictantur] Halm quotes Cicero,
Tusc. (iv. c. 8), “afflictatio aegritudo 011111
vexatione eorporis;’' and accordingly he
says that ¹ afflictantur’ expresses the highest
extet-nal expression of grief, shown hy
wringing of 1110. hands, beating of the
breast. He also observes that the whole
passage is a masterly example of the figure
Merismos. Be it so.
