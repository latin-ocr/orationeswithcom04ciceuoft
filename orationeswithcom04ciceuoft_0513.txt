esse, utrum illi, qui istam rem gesserunt, homicidae sint an vindices
libertatis? XIII. Attende enim paullisper, cogitationemque sobrii
hominis punctum temporis suscipe. Ego, qui sum illorum, ut ipse
fateor, familiaris, ut a te arguor, socius, nego quidquam esse me-
dium: confiteor eos, nisi liberatores populi Romani conservato-
resque rei publicae sint, plus quam sicarios, plus quam homicidas,
plus etiam quam parricidas esse3 siquidem est atrocius patriae
parentem quam suum occidere. Tu'homo sapiens et considerate,
quid dicis? Si parricidas, cur honoris caussa a te sunt et in hoc
ordine et apud populum Romanum semper appellati? Cur M.
Brutus referente te legibus est solutus, si ab urbe plus quam decem

δὴ τῶν νόμων), that is, they are free from all
legal obligation and bound by no written
law.'’ Again, he says (c. ⁶28), that Augus-

13. referente te leqibus . . . solutus]
See the Introd. Brutus was Praetor urba-
nus, and could not legally be absent more

than ten days from the city without being
released from this legal obligation. See
‘legibus solutus’ De Imp. Cn. Pomp. c.
21, and the note, Vol. ii.

Abrami pertinently refers to an instruc-
tive passage in Asconius, Argum. ad Cor-
nelianam, p. 57, ed. Orelli: ‘¹ promulgavit-
que legem, qua auctoritatem senatus mi·
nuebat, ne quis nisi per populum legibus
solveretur. Quod antiquo quoque jure erat
cautum, itaque in omnibus senatus consul-
tis, quibus aliquem legibus solvi placebat,
adjici erat solitum, nt dc ea re ad populum
ferretur3 sed paulatim ferri erat desitum,
resque jam in eam consuetudinem venerat
ut postremo ne adjiceretur quidem in sena-
tus consultis de rogatione ad populum fe-
renda, eaque ipsa senatusconsulta per pau-
culos admodum fiebant.'’ A little after he
says: ‘⁶ Tum Cornelius ita ferre rursus eoe-
pit, ne quis in senatu legibus solveretur,
nisi CC adfuissent, neve quis, quum solu-
tus esset, intercederet, quum dc ea re ad
populum ferretur. Haec sine tumultu res
acta est. Nemo enim negare poterat pro
auctoritate senatus esse cam legem. Sed
tamen eam tulit invitis optimatibus.''

‘Legibus solutus’ is said of a person
who is released from the obligation of a
single Lex, asin the case of a man being
released from the obligation of the Lex An-
nalis, and in the caso of C. Caesar who was
released from the obligation of being pre-
sent in order to be a candidate for a second
consulship. Dion (53, c. 17 and la) speak-
ing of Augustus obtaining a Monnrehia has
a dissertation on the imperial power, in
which hc consounds the powers of Augus-
tus with those of the emperors who lived
when he wrote. He says, “ 'rho Imperatores
are released freni the Leges (λέλυνται γὰρ

tus having promised to give a hundred de-
narii to each of the citizens, deelared that
he would not publish the Edictum about this
matter “ until the senate had released him
from all obligation to the laws, in order that,
as I have said (c. 18), being in fact abso-
lute and master of himself and of the laws,
he might do all that he liked and might not
do what he did not like.'’ But here itis
plain, that, though Dion uses such general
terms, he is speaking of Augustus being re-
leased from a special Lex, and released by
the vote of the senate. Dion seems to
be speaking of the Lex Cincia de mu-
neribus, as Noodt maintains (Opp. T. i.
p. 269, quoted by Reimarus). Again (54,
c. 10), Dion says that the senate entreated
Augustus ‘⁴ to set straight every thing (that
he has mentioned), and to propose such
laws (νομοθετεῖν) as he pleased.” But
though he has spoken in such general
terms of the imperial power of Augustus,
he plainly shows by what he says in parti-
cular that the forms of legislation were still
preserved.

The S. consultum about Vespasian does
not go further than this as to the Princeps
being ⁴ legibus solutus τ’ ‘¹ Utique quibus
legibus plebeivc scitis scriptum fuit ne
Divus Aug. Tiberiusve Julius Caesar
Aug. Tiberiusque Claudius Caesar Aug.
Germanicus tenerentur iis legibus plebis-
que scitis Imp. Caesar Vespasianus solutus
sit.'’ The expression ‘ solutus legibns'
therefore under the imperial system has
a definite meaning. Ulpian's ‹lm-trine
‘princeps legibus solutus est' (mg. 1. 3.
31) is merely an excerpt ‘ex libro xiii. ad
legem Juliam et I’apiam,' and therefore
merely means that he was not bound hy this
Lex, as the rest os the excerpt clearly shows.
