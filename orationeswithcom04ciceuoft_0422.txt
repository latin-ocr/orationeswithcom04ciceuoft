400 ORAT. PRO Q. LIGARIO. 1

Cornelia, as we may conclude from a passage of Suetonius (Caesar,
c. 76).

I do not accept all this even as a probable conjecture. As to the
assumption that Tubero being a jurist, or a man acquainted with law,
would not accuse another without having a Lex to found his charge
upon, the answer is, that Tubero having sailed in this matter left the
business of oratory and turned jurist, and he became a distinguished
lawyer (Pomponius, Dig. i. 2. 2, ἓ 46). As to the charge of Perduellio
or Majestas, there is nothing in this oration that justifies the assump-
tion that he was tried on this charge, or that he was tried on any charge.
Caesar was Dictator, and had the power of keeping his enemies out of
Rome and Italy, if he liked. It must be admitted that Cicero dexter-
ously covers over that part of Ligarius’ conduct which was most offen-
sive to Caesar, his resistance in Africa, but if Ligarius was tried, we
may certainly affirm that the speech would show what he was tried for.
The speech shows plainly that it was no trial, for Ligarius was not at
Rome to be tried. The only matter on which the speech turns is
whether Caesar will pardon Ligarius and allow him to return to Rome,
not whether he will acquit him or inflict a penalty on him. Pomponius'
statement is the true reason why Tubero opposed Ligarius' brothers and
Cicero when they were soliciting Quintus’ pardon, and Ligarius’ hos-
tility to Caesar during the African campaign was the matter which
Tubero urged to show that Ligarius ought not to be pardoned and
allowed to return from exile. Tubero, though a pardoned man himself,
could say that he gave up the contest when he saw that Caesar had
defeated his great opponent, and he could urge with some reason against
Ligarius, both the treatment that he had received from him before
Utica, at a time when they were both on one side, and the further fact
that Ligarius remained with the partizans of Cn. Pompeius in Africa
after Pompeius' death, and did all that he could against Caesar, even
when victory had declared for him, and Rome and the senate had sub-
mitted. Caesar had particular reasons for being irritated against the men
who fought in this African war, a campaign in which he had the greatest
difficulties to encounter, and in which he showed all his great talents (Ad
Div. vi. 13). It is no wonder if he felt resentment against Q. Ligarius,
one of the few men of any note who survived a war which was as hazard-
ous to Caesar as his campaign against Pompeius in Epirus and Thes-
saly ¹. Ligarius and others who still held out with the help of J uba and
his Africans, might be considered as resisting the majesty of Rome, and

of his “ Memoires militaires sur les Grecs et les Romains.'' La Haye, 1758.
