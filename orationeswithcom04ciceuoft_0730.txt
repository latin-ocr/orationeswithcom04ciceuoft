t'ar this was the popular belief in Cicero's
time, and particularly among the soldier-53
but it is probable that the belief in a future
life was more common among the people
than among the rich and great. Cicero
spoke of this opinion just as it served 1115
purpose. In the oration Pro Cluentio (c.
61, and the note) we have his declaration
that punishment aster death is an idle story.

bene redditae] This is explained by the
word ‘1·eddita‚’ which he has already used
in this chapter. Muretus remarks that
there 15 much in the close of this speech
which the orator seems to have sasbioned
after Pericles' funeral oration in Thucydides.
The sentiment ⁴ Brevis. . .sempiterna'is well
expressed. Cicero could do this—⁴ nobis
vita ⁷ ai, ‘vita vobis ⁷ b v, Halm.

Quae si non esset . . . quis esset lam
amens] He has often said this: If the re-
meinbrance of the dead did not extend be-
yond their life who would be fool enough
to undergo labour and danger to get prais e
and glory .>—A inea 11 :ind miseiable doc-
tune What would he have saiil if he had
been told that many men labour and risk
their lives without ever thinking of praise
and glory? What is the praise of the ob-
scure ; and what their glory who labour for
their living, because they know that they

ger more than the soldier‘s, and think nei-
ther of fame and glory while they live, nor
what people will say of them when they are
dead ? The heroism of thousands who
struggle for their daily bread, of the poor,
of the unknown, unrequioed, unhonoured‚
aud forgotten3 what would become of it if
they were as mean as Cicero would have
men to be? But Cicero was an orator. He
spoke for the occasion. See Pro Archia,
c. 1-2, and the note.

eorum qui mmo sunt] ι011115 present
generation,’ ⁴ of the living,’ opposed to ‘ pos-
terorum.' The practice of pointing ‘ eorum,
qui nunc sunt, nec ' &c.‚ destroys the pro-
priety of the words.

insepulta] ‘insepulta ' i v, ‘ sepulta ¹ a b.
Halm, who, I suppose, misunderstood the
passage. Ferrarius, who took ‘insepulta‚'
understood it right z ⁴ Your services will not,
if either the living forget them, or poste-
rity never speak of them, be without their
sepulchre, for the senate and the Roman
people will have raised for you almost with
their own hands an evei-lasting memorial!
If we take the reading ⁴ sepulta‚' it is easy
to give it a meaning: ‘ your services will
not be buried in oblivion ' &c.

numquam de] ‘numquamque de ² Halm,
who does not say where he found the ‘ que.’
