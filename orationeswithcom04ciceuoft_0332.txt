310 ORAT. PRO G. RABIRIO POSTUMO

sustinuit, re, [fortuna,] fide, hodieque sustinet; nec amicum pru-
dentem corruere patitur, nee illius animi aciem praestringit splendor
sui nominis, nec mentis quasi luminibus officit altitudo fortunae ct
gloriae. Sint sane illa magna, quae re vera inagna sunt: de judicio
animi mei ut volet quisque sentiat3 ego enim hanc in tantis opibus,
tanta fortuna, liberalitatem in suos, memoriam amicitiae reliquis
virtutibus omnibus antepono. Quam quidem vos, judices, ejus in
novo genere bonitatem, inusitatam claris ac praepotentibus viris,
non modo non aspernari ac refutare, sed complecti etiam et augere
debetis, et eo magis quod videtis hos quasi sumptos dies ad labe-
factandum illius dignitatem, ex qua illi nihil detrahi potest, quod
1100 aut fortiter ferat aut facile restituat. Amicissimum hominem
si honestate spoliatum audierit, nec sine magno dolore feret, nec id
amiserit quod posse speret recuperari.

XVII. Satis multa hominibus non iniquis haec esse debent,
nimis etiam multa vobis, quos aequissimos esse confidimus. Sed ut
omnium vel suspicioni vel malevolentiae vel crudelitati satis fiat,
“ occultat pecuniam Postumus, latent regiae divitiae.” Ecquis est
ex tanto populo qui bona G. Rabirii Postumi nummo sestertio sibi
addici velit? Sed, miserum me 1 quanto 1100 dixi cum dolore !
Hem, Postume, tune es G. Curti filius, G. Rabirii judicio et volun—
tate filius, natura sororis filius? Tune ille in omnes tuos liberalis,

dentem ε’ codd. Perhaps we should read
⁴ imprudentem‚’ one of Halm’s suggestions.

illius animi] ⁴ Illius' is Caesar: ‘The
splendour of his own name does not dazzle
Caesar’s visnal power, nor does the elevation
of his fortune and his glory intercept the
view, if I may so express it, from the win-
dows of his mind.y He does right to apolo-

gize for the expression by ‘ quasi.’ The

ι metaphor is legal, and derived from the

rules of law about not obstrueting 01·
damaging a neighbour's lights. See De
Harusp. Resp. c. 15, and the note. He
has the metaphor again in the Brutus, 0.
17: “ sic Catonis luminibus obstruxit haec
posteriorum quasi exaggerata altius oratio.’'

refutare] ⁴ To throw back‚' ‘ reject ' (Ιο-
dex).—‘ quasi sumptos:' the time of Ra-
birius’ trial seemed 10 be purposely selected
to damage Caesar’s character or reputation.
—‘posse speret:’ the reading of G. The
other MSS. bave ‘ posse non speret3' which
would spoil the sense.

17. ‘⁴ occultat . . . divitiae'’] The sup-
posed objection of the prosecutor, or of the
enemies of Rabirius—⁴ addici :' knocked
down to him at auction. Cicero is playing
the ‘ praeco‚’ or crier. See Vol. iii, Index.

Pro P. Quintio, c. 15, and the note.

Curti] codd. See 0. 2.—‘ condemnetur
0 vobis :’ these words are omitted by Halm
on the advice of Madvig, as being inserted
by somebody who was very far from the
meaning. It certainly seems inconsistent
10 say that Rabirius wishes to be condemned.
A difficulty has also been raised about the
sale. Cicero speaks as if the creditors might
be paid if there was a sale, and this implies
that there was property. It is suggested
that after a sale and payment there would
be nothing left, and, of course, if a man
bought Rabirius' property with the charge
of debts, it would be worth no more than 0
(5051011105) We are imperfectly acquainted
with the law under which Rabirius fell. It
is easy 10 500 that there is a difficulty here,
and nothing is easier than 10 strike *out the
words which cause the difficulty. But that
is a feeble kind of eriticism under the guise
of boldness. After all, as the text stands,
Rabirius is supposed to wish to discharge
his obligations by the sale of his property
(nihil jam aliud nisi fidem curat); which
was a great calamity itself, as we learn from
the oration Pro P. Quintio. (Vol. ii.)
