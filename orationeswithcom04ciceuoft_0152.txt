130 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

vir et· animo et virtute praecellens pro nostro imperio periculo suo
dimicaret, graviter id jure ferremus minui auxilia populi Romani,
debilitari animos fortissimorum virorum, alienigenarum nos hominum
studiis atque patria virtute privari. Atqui nihil interest, judices,
utrum haec foederati jura constituant, ut ne cui liceat ex iis
civitatibus ad nostrorum bellorum pericula accedere, an quae nos
eorum civibus virtutis caussa tribuerimus, ea rata esse non possint.
Nihil enim magis uteremur his adjutoribus, sublatis virtutis praemiis,
quam si omnino his versari in nostris bellis non liceret. Etenim,-
quum pro sua patria pauci post genus hominum natum reperti sint,
qui nullis praemiis propositis vitam suam hostium telis objecerint,
pro aliena re publica quemquam fore putatis qui se opponat peri-
culis, non modo nullo proposito praemio, sed etiam interdicto?

XI. Sed quum est illud imperitissime dictum de populis fundis,
quod commune est liberorum populorum, non proprium foedera-
torum, ex quo intelligi necesse est aut neminem ex sociis civem
fieri posse aut etiam posse ex foederatis, tum vero jus omne noster
iste magister mutandae civitatis ignorat3 quod est, judiceS, non

has ‘iis' in both cases. The MSS. have
both ‘iis ’ and ‘ his ’ as usual.

ll. quod commune] ‘ quia commune,’
Halm, Baiter3 a change for which there is
no reason at all. In c. 8 it is said : ‘⁴ Quid
enim potuit dici imperitius quam foederatos
populos fieri fundos oportere? Nam id non
magis est proprium foederatorum quam om-
nium liberorum.’' Accordingly ‘illud,’ or
that which the prosecutor had said about
‘ populi fundi‚’ was said by a man who did
not know what he was talking about3 for
what he said (quod) applies to all ‘liberi
populi.’ ‘ Ex quo,' from this general prin-

ciple which is here laid down.
“ jus . . mutandae] He knows no-
thing of the law about a man’s changing
his state 3 which a Roman could do without
asking permission. The Roman laW, as
Cicero says. did not allow a citizen to be
deprived ofhis citizenship3 ‘ nor, if he should
choose to give up his citizenship, is he with-
out the power of doing it‚' if he is only ad-
mitted to be a citizen of another state. The
principle is simple. A Roman could give
up his Roman citizenship, and indeed must
give it up, as Cicero says, if he was admitted
to the citizenship of another state. Osen-

Caecina (c. 34), where Cicero says that a
man who had been given up to the enemy
and the enemy had refused to receive him,
was still a citizen ; and Osenbrueggen com-
pares with the passage in the Caecina this
passage, which contains the words ‘modo
adsciscatur.’ The jurisconsults, he says,
were of opinion that if the Populus Romanus
had ordered a man to be given up to the
enemy, the man lost his civitas (Dig. 50. 7.
17; 49Δ 15. 4). Osenbrueggen concludes
that there was no fixed law on the matter,
and that the practice shows there was not.
For in the case of Maximus (De Or. i. 54),
who was given up to the Numantini and
not accepted by them, it was a disputed
point whether he recovered his civitas by
virtue of the Postliminium when he re-
turned. Pomponius says (Dig. 50. 7. 17)
that a Lex was afterwards enacted to give
him the Roman civitas3 which is evidence
that he was considered to have lost it.

But Cicero in this passage is not speaking
of such a case as that in the oration Pro
Caecina. Generally, he says that a man
cannot lose his ‘civitas’ against his will;
and generally, this was true, though there
were exceptions to the rule. Again, he says.
that he cannot help losing the civitas, if be
is admitted as a citizen of another state3
and if his doctrine is true that by the Ro-
