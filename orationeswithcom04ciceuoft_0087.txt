CAP. 18, 19. 65
ratio et bonis artibus instituta, et cura et vigiliis elaborata. Atque
scitote, judices, eas cupiditates quae objiciuntur Caelio, atque haec
studia de quibus disputo, non facile in eodem homine esse posse.
Fieri enim non potest ut animus libidini deditus, amore, desiderio,
cupiditate, saepe nimia copia, inopia etiam nonnumquam impeditus,
1100 quidquid est quod nos facimus in dicendo, non modo agendo,
verum etiam cogitando possit sustinere. An vos aliam caussam
esse ullam putatis cur in tantis praemiis eloquentiae, tanta volup-
tate dicendi, tanta laude, tanta gratia, tanto honore, tani sint pauci
semperque fuerint, qui in hoc labore versentur? Obterendae
sunt omnes voluptates; relinquenda studia delectationis; ludus,
jocus, convivium, sermo paene est familiarium deserendus. Quae
res in 1100 genere homines a labore studioque dicendi deterret, non
quo aut ingenia deficiant aut doctrina puerilis. An hic, si sese isti
vitae dedisset, consularem hominem admodum adolescens in judi-

inopia etiam] He says first ‘ saepe nimia
copia‚¹ ⁴ often from excessive means of en-
joyment3’ and excess may be followed by
⁶ inopia‚’ want of the means of enjoyment.
But this is not exactly what 110 11103115. A
man of pleasure is hindered from following
other pursuits by enjoyment, when he has
the means (copia), and by looking for the
means, when he has not got them.—‘ quod
nos facimus,' &c.: ‘⁴ quod nos facimus in
(licendo, quoquo modo facimus, non modo
agendo,'’ Halm, following Madvig. He
means to say that no man who is given to
pleasure can sustain the part of an orator, as
Cicero himself did, whatever may be the
worth of Cicero’s 0131011031 power-3 such a
man cannot sustain even the mental labour
of the orator, to say nothing of the bodily
exertion (non modo agendo).

An vos aliam] He says in his treatise
De Oratore (i. 4 and 5), that the number of
great orators had been small ; and the rea-
son that he assigns for this scarcity is the
difficulty of the thing. And this is true, for
most oratory is, as he says, “ verborum
volubilitas inanis atque irridenda.’' A readi—
ness in uttering words is 3 vulgar power,
and may be acquin-ed by most people. But
to speak well, 10 say on any given matter
what is proper and no 11101·ος and to say it
clearly, forcibly, and in such way as to con-
vince and persuade is an art as rare 35 the
art of writing well, and perhaps much more
difficult to acquire. Cicero in his treatise
De Oratore and in the Brutus has 3 good
deal about the study of eloquence. Like
many of t-he finer arts it belonged to an age
that is past; and if it is ever 10 be revived,

we must labour at it 35 1110 Greeks and Ro-
mans did.

tanta voluptate] There is a reading
‘tanta voluntate' E„ which would mean
‘when so many are willing to speaks But
I suppose he means by ‘tanta voluptate
dicendi,' ⁴ when people take so much plea—
sure in oratory,' in listening to it.

Quae res in lzoe yeuere, (1.0] The read-
ing of S. Halm following Madvig has,
‘ Quare in hoc genere labor offendit
homines a studioque deterret,' which 15 1110
reading of P. E. G. with a slight alteration.
—-‘ doctrina puerilis :’ boys were taught
their rhetoric at school; but such teaching
will not make an orator, though it may
help. Orelli begs us to observe how Tullius
in the republican time speaks of this school
instruction as of less value than the practice
in the forum, whereas under the empire
rhetorical teachin g was every thing—Oratory
exists only in a free state: but it does not
exist because a state is free3 of which we have
proof enough. Two things must exist in
order that eloquence may exist, political free-
(lom and 3 laborious study of oratory. Poli-
tical frecdom alone only produces talk.—
⁴ dedisset ι’ ⁴ dedidisset,' Halm.

consularem hominem] Cicero’s former
colleague C. Antonius, whom Caelius prose-
cuted ac. 59. Quintilian (inst. iv. 2. 123)
quotes 3 passage from Caelins’ speech. in
which he describes the profligate habits of
the man 011 some foreign service. John οῖ
Salisbury (Policraticus sive Do Nngis (Turi-
ulium, viii. c. 13) lias the sanie passage, no
doubt taken from Quintilian, though he
does not say so.
