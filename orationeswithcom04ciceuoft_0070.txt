ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO

cujus ipse sibi perpetuam licentiam optaret; nec, si sibi semel
periculum ambitus subeundum putaret, ipse alterum iterum ambitus

crimine arcesseret.

secuted Atratinus’ father De ambitu3 and
it is said, on his acquittal prosecuted him
again (iterum ambitus crimine). Ι do not
know how he could prosecute a man after
his acquittal, and on the same charge. Yet
Cicero says so (c. 31), “quem absolutum
insequitur, revocat.’'

cupidus] P. E„ ‘ cupidinis ’ G. Ernesti
following Lambinus thinks ‘ cupidus’ is a
gloss, but, as Halm observes, such a prose-
cutor is properly called ‘cupidus,’ as wit-
nesses are called ‘cupidi' in a like case.
See what he says of Caelius in c. 31.
Weiske corrupted the reading into ‘ cupi-
dius,' and Orelli accepted what he calls
‘ optima conjectura)

tabulae flayz'lalae] Caelius is asked to
produce his account books that he may
prove his enemies’ charges. Rather an im-
pudent thing to ask of a man. However
he had none: he was in the ‘ patria potes-
tas,' had no property, and kept no books
(¹tabulas . . . nullas conficit'). Abrami
has a note here, not very exact. It is now
well understood that the son who was in the
father’s power could have no property, and,
as Cicero says, having nothing, he kept no
accounts. Formally Cicero was right, but
in practic'e it seems that though the law
did not allow such a son to hold property,
he must for his own convenience have kept
some account of what he laid out. A man
might be a magistratus, as Caelius had
been, and even a consul, and as such inde-
pendent of the ‘patria potestas,' but in
respect to his father he was still subjected
to him like a child. “The legal capacity
of children who are in the father’s power
may be expressed in the following simple
principle. The child is incapable in the
Jus Privatum of having any power or domi-
nion (ownership) ; in every other respect he
has a perfect legal capacity. Also that in-
capacity is not to be viewed as an incapacity
resting in the child itself, but simply as the
consequence of the rule of lam according
to which the father acquires all the rights

which arise out of the acts of his child. It
was consequently in the Jus Privatum only
that such a limitation was observed, not in
the Jus Publicum. Hence the son, like
the father, could vote in the Comitia, nay,
even enjoy the highest Honores ” (Savigny,
System διο. ii. p. 52). .

Versuram . . . ullam] The son could
not by borrowing put his father under the
obligation of paying, for a son by his acts
could improve his father's condition, but
could not make it worse, as appears from a
passage in the Digest (Dig. 50. 17. 133),
where the rule is laid down only as to slaves
and their masters, but, as Savigny observes,
children and slaves in this respect were on
the same footing. But a ‘ filiusfamilias '
could contract Obligationes‚ and could be
sued on them : “ Filiusfamilias ex omnibus
caussis tamquam paterfamilias obligatur, et
ob id agi cum eo tamquam cum patrefami-
lias potest” (Dig. 44. 7. 39; quoted by
Savigny). Hotmann rightly explained
‘versuram facere) It means to borrow.
Abrami falls into the blunder of supposing
that it means ‘ mutare creditorem.' Grae-
vius observes that people confound ‘ver-
sura solvere ⁷ and ⁴ versuram facere :’ ‘ ver-
suram facere’ is to borr0w3 ‘versura sol-
vere,y to borrow in order to pay an old
debt.

habitationis] He had a lodging in Clo-
dius’ insula, or block. You say that he
paid thirty thousand for the rent of his
apartments, which shows that your friend
Clodius wishes to sell his insula, and to
make pcople believe that it is worth more
than it is. Accordingly Cicero adds ‘ad
tempus ejus ⁹ δια, ‘ you have invented a lie
to help him in his present circumstances.'
The ‘ habitatio’ is a room or set of rooms
in an ‘insula' or building which contains
many sets of apartments. The tenant is
¹habitator.' His rooms are sometimes
called ‘caenacula‚' or as here ‘aediculae.’
The rent was a ‘pensio,' payment. The
owner of the ‘insula' was ‘dominus in-
