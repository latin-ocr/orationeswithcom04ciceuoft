424 PRO REGE DEIOTARO.

is Deiotarus’ son-in-law (Caesar, B. C. iii. 4), Deiotarus put him to death
after the battle of Pharsalus, but whether this happened before Caesar
came to Galatia or after, we do not know ¹. In a passage of saidas
(s. v. Κάστωρ) we are told that Deiotarus put his son-in-law Castor to
death because he had accused him before Caesar, and Halm accepts
this statement, which may be true or false.

The king sent several of his friends to Rome to defend him before
Caesar, and among them his slave and physician Phidippus, whom we
may assume to have been a Greek. But Castor gained over Phidippus,‘
who gave evidence against the king. The case was heard before Caesar
in his house in the month of November (13.0. 45), in the presence of
some of his friends. The charge of a design to assassinate Caesar
seems very improbable, and Cicero has briefly answered that. But
Deiotarus was also charged generally with being hostile to Caesar, and
with looking out for his opportunity during the African war, when his
accusers declared that he sent aid to Syria to Caecilius Bassus, who was
in arins there against Caesar (e. 8, 9, Sec.) This-part of the accusation
is imperfectly answered, and probably it was true. Cicero sent a copy
of this speech to his son—in-law Dolabella (Ad Div. ix. 12). He speaks
of the case of Deiotarus as of no great importance and not worth the
labour of a carefully-written oration. He describes it as a piece of coarse
homespun work, like the presents of Deiotarus. Perhaps he sent a
copy to the pious old Gallogreek too, for this king was a careful observer
of religious forms (Cic. De Divin. ii. 8), and yet a cruel tyrant, if we
may believe all that is said of him.

Caesar made no decision. After his death the ambassadors of Deio-
tarus, who must have remained at Rome, if Cicero's story is true, agreed
to give to Antonius ten millions of sesterces, on which Antonius fixed
up in the Capitol a notice that according to Caesar's decree Deiotarus
should recover all that had been taken from him 3 but Deiotarus on hear-
ing of Caesar's death had helped himself, and taken possession of all that
he had been deprived of (Cic. Phil. ii. e. 37). He was now a very old
man. His son Deiotarus had received the title of king, a usual kind of
Roman compliment‚ at the time when Cicero was governor of Cilicia
(Rc. 51),and the father and the son are both named kings by Cicero
(Phil. xi. o. 12).

¹ Halm assumes that when Strabo (p. 568) says Γορβεοῦς τὸ τοῦ Κάστορος βασίλειον
τοῦ Σαωκονδαρίου, he means that Deiotarus’ son-in-law was named Castor Saocondarius,
as he infers from the passage in Caesar, and as Oudendorp and Muretus had already sup-
posed. If this is 50, Castor, the grandson of Deiotarus, and his accuser, was the son of
Castor called also Tarcundarius, οι· some such name. Suidas' testimony is not worth
much, for he calls Deiotarus a senator, and confounds Deiotarus' son-in-law Castor with
the rhetorician and historian Castor, as Clinton also does (Fasti, iii. 546), as Halm

remarks.
