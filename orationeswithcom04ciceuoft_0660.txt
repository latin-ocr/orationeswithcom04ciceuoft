638 ORAT. PHILIPPIOARUM LIBER UNDEGIMUS.

populo Romano conspirasse sensisset, fretus Antonii copiis ea
scelera suscepit, quae'Romae jam suscepta arbitrabatur a socio
furoris sui. Quid ergo hunc aliud moliri, quid optare censetis aut
quam omnino caussam esse belli? Omnes qui libere de re pubae
lica sensimus, qui dignas nobis sententias diximus, qui populum
Romanum liberum esse voluimus, statuit ille quidem non inimicos,
sed hostes: majora tamen in nos quam in hostem supplicia medi-
tatur: mortem naturae [poenam] putat esse, iracundiae tormenta
atque cruciatum. Qualis igitur hostis habendus est is a quo victore
si cruciatus absit, mors in beneficii parte numeretur? ΙΙ. Quam-
obrem, patres conscripti, quamquam hortatore non egetiS, ipsi enim
vestra sponte exarsistis ad libertatis recuperandae cupiditatem,
tamen eo majore animo studioque libertatem defendite, quo majora
proposita victis supplicia servitutis videtis. In Galliam invasit
Antonius, in Asiam Dolabella3 in alienam uterque provinciam.
Alteri se Brutus objecit, impetumque furentis atque omnia divexare
ac diripere cupientis vitae suae periculo colligavit, progressu arcuit,
a reditu refrenavit: obsideri se passus ex utraque parte constrinxit
Antonium. Alter in Asiam irrupit. Gur? Si ut in Syriam, pate-
bat via et certa neque longa. Quid opus fuit cum legione? prae-
misso Marso nescio quo Octavio, scelerato latrone atque egente, qui
popularetur agros, vexaret urbes, non ad spem constituendae rei
familiaris, quam tenere eum posse negant qui norunt—mihi enim
hic senator ignotus est—sed ad praesentem pastum mendicitatis

hunc aliud] ⁴ Hunc' is Antonius, who
will do the same that Dolabella has done.

Halm has printed them in italics. Thjs
addition is without any authority, so far as

naturae [poenam]] Faernus thought that
‘ poenam ' should be erased, and perhaps he
is right. Cicero would then say that ⁴ death
comes from nature, torture and cruelty
from violent passion.' Lambinus agrees
with Faernus. See In Cat. iv. c. 4, and the
notes.

2. Cur? Si] There is some difficulty
here. In place of ⁴ Cur? Si ’ D has ‘ cur-
sim? various attempts have been made to
correct the passage. As it stands here the
meaning seems plain: ⁴ Why ? if his object
wasto reach Syria, the road to Syria was
open and plain and not a long road.’ The
shortest road did not lie through Asia.
⁴ What need was there to go with a legion ἓ ⁷
If Dolabella preferred taking the road
through Asia, there was no occasion for
taking a legion with him and sending on
with it the plunderer Octavius. After the
words ¹ neque longa ' Lambinus inserted
the words ‘ Sin ut ad Trebonium,’ and

I know.

cum leyz'one ? . . . Octavio] The legion,
says Manutius, was given to him by Anto-
nius, and he refers to Appian, B. C. iii.
Perhaps he means the passage in c. 25.
This Octavius is named Marcus Octavius
by Dion (47, c. 30). Appian (B. C. iv. c.
62) names him Marsus. *When Cassius
took Laodicea, in which Dolabella was shut
up with Octavius, the man who was Dola-
bella’s bodyguard cut off his master's head
in obedience to orders. Octavius killed
himself.

hic senator] He means Octavius, who,
we must assume. had got into the senate,
but Cicero did not know him-⁴ Nulla sus-
picione belliz' Ι have followed Halm in
making ‘Nulla suspicione’ begin a new
sentence. He says that Rau changed the
pointing. This is an improvement in place
of ‘ consecutus est Dolabella nulla suspi-
cione belli. Quis enim ' &c.
