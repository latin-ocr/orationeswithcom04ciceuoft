446 INTRODUOTION

associates„ he left Rome. Pompeius would not help him, and Caesar,
who was going to his province of Gallia, waited before the gates of Rome
until he saw that Cicero had left. Cicero’s own admissions show plainly
that his exile was the work of Caesar’s intrigues; and Cicero never for-
gave Caesar. Immediately after Cicero had left Rome, Clodius procured
a formal enactment against Cicero, by which he was prevented from)
remaining within four hundred miles of Rome.

With his exile begin Cicero's humiliation and degradation, from
which he never recovered until after Caesar's death, when Antonius had
left Rome, and Cicero again spoke like a man (Phil. v. c. 14) in the
orations entitled Philippicae. Here we have his real opinions about
Caesar and his faction.

Cicero was recalled from exile in Bc. {Z and he entered Rome in
September. His restoration was effected by the zeal of some of his
friends, who could act with more advantage after Clodius had retired
from his tribunate, and they had the aid of Pompeius, who had been
insulted by Clodius. Caesar also was consulted, and he consented to
Cicero’s restoration. ’

The speeches which Cicero delivered after his return (Quum Senatui,
&c.; Quum Populo, &c., Vol. iii.), are not preserved. Those speeches
which are now extant under these titles are spurious, as I believe with
some critics3 and even if we admit them to be genuine, we can learn
hardly any thing from them which we do not learn better from Cicero’s
other orations and his letters. The oration in defence of Sestius (Vol.
iii.) who had been active in effecting Cicero's restoration, is both a de-
fence of Sestius, an apology for Cicero, and a history somewhat veiled
of the intrigues which drove him from Rome. He speaks of Caesar, the
real cause of his disgrace, in the tone of a man who feels that he has
been wronged and dares not complain. He was afraid of Caesar, and
courted his favour. The union which Caesar, Pompeius, and M. Crassus
formed for the purpose of securing their several interests, a union some-
times incorrectly called the first triumvirate, was completed or confirmed
at Luca, a place on the west side of Italy, and within the limits of Cae-
sar's province of Gallia Cisalpina, where Pompeius and Crassus met him
early in Bc. 56. The oration De Provinciis Consularibus (Vol. iv.),
which belongs to this period, is a panegyric on Caesar, whose Gallie
victories had made him the most conspicuous person in the Roman]
state, and Cicero could praise and flatter him without offending Pom-
peius, who had become Caesar's son-in-law by marrying his daughter
Julia (13.0. 59). In Bc. 54 Cicero's brother Quintus joined Caesar in
Gallia as one of his Legati, and thus the reconciliation between the great
orator and the successful general seemed complete. Cicero corresponded
with Caesar as a friend, but he wrote more like a courtly flatterer than
