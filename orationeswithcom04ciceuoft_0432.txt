410 ORAT. l'sso Q. LIGARIO

fuit, velle se de Q. Ligarii scelere dicere. Non dubito quin admi-
ratus sis, vel quod de nullo alio [quisquam], vel quod is quiin
eadem caussa fuisset, vel quidnam novi [sceleris] afferret. Scelus
tu illud vocas, Tubero? Cur? Isto enim nomine illa adhuc caussa
caruit. Alii errorem appellant, alii timorem3 qui durius, spem,
cupiditatem, odium, pertinacian13 qui gravissime, temeritatem3
scelus, praeter te adhuc nemo. Ac mihi quidem, si proprium et
vorum nomen nostri mali quaeritur, fatalis quaedam calamitas inci·-
disse videtur et improvidas hominum mentes occupavisse, ut nemo
mirari debeat humana consilia divina necessitate esse superata.
Liceat esse miseros—quamquam hoc victore esse non possumus—-
sed non loquor de nobis3 de illis loquor qui occiderunt. Fuerint
cupidi, fuerint irati, fuerint pertinaces: sceleris vero crimine, fu·-
roris, parricidii, liceat Cn. Pompeio mortuo, liceat multis aliis

carere.

Quando hoc quisquam ex te, Caesar, audivit, aut tua quid
aliud arma voluerunt nisi a te contumeliam propulsare ἓ

Quid egit

tuus invictus exercitus, nisi ut suum jus tueretur et dignitatem

tuam ἕ

proach a person, generally one in authority3

Quid, tu quum pacem esse cupiebas, idne agebas ut tibi

Caesar’s own expressions. This may bc

and ‘postulatio' has its ordinary technical so, but we cannot be sure that we get

use, which is to ask the praetor (exempli
gratia) for permission to commence pro-
ceedings against a person.

[quisquam]] Haupt conjectured ⁴ quic-
quam‚' which, says Halm, is confirmed by
the codex of Oehler. Mommsen, says
Baiter, saw that ‘quisquam' was a glos-
sema; for it is only Tubero of whom Cicero
is speaking.

novi] Some MSS. add ‘sceleris,’ others
⁴ facinoris! ‘¹ Novi (deleto substantivo) Pa-
tricius '' (Baiter). But Patricius is not so
positive: he frequently offers several things
for our choice. He seems to have often
changed his mind. “ Facz‘norz's fere delerem,
vel si quis refragaretur, etiam relinquerem;
vel denique quod in quibusdam veteribus
Lambinus scribit se reperisse, in sceleris
commutarem.”

quaeritur] ‘quaeratur ’ G. E. But ‘ quae-
ratur' would require ‘videatur ' in the cor-
responding member of the sentence.—‘ ut
nemo ι’ this is the common Roman formula
of a conclusion, ‘ And therefore no man need
wonder if human wisdom was overpowered
by supernatural necessity) ‘ Fatum ' did it
all. Pro Marcello, c. 6. Halm quotes one
of Dion’s speeches of Caesar in the senate
(43, c. l7): οἶκειωθώμεν ἐκλαθόμενοι πάν-
των τῶν συμβεβηκότων, ὡς καὶ ἀνάγκῃ
τινὶ δαιμονίᾳ γεγονότων; and he says, per-
haps Cicero here with great tact uses

Caesar's own expressions from Dion, for

this tasteless man did not use Caesar’s own

speeches, even when he had them before
him. (Vol. ii. p. 294 and the note.)

parricidii] A traitor to his country was
sometimes called ‘ parricida) “ It was the
court fashion in the time of Tiberius (Tacit,
Aun. iv. 34) to call Brutus and Cassius
‘parricidae,’ as the example of t'nc venal
historian Valerius Maximus shows” (Halm).
For once the court tone was right. What
else were Caesar’s assassins and Cicero too ?

contumeliam] Caesar's own words, to
which Manutius refers ε “ Doluisse se quod
populi Romani beneficium sibi per contume-
liam ab inimicis extorqueretur, ereptoque
semestri imperio in urbem retraheretur, cu-
jus absentis rationem haberi proximis comi-
tiis populusjussisset ” (B. C. i. 9). The ⁴ be-
neficium ' was the permission which had been
granted to Caesar to be a candidate a second
time for the consulship in his absence from
Rome.

pacem . . . cupiebas] Caesar professed a
desire for peace several times, but he al-
ways wanted good terms for himself. A
victorious general at the head of a veteran
army would not have been content with a
little. Cicero in a letter to Tiro (Ad Div.
xvi. 12) mentions the terms which Caesar
offered after he had taken Ariminum, Pi-
sautum, Ancona, and Arretium, and he says
