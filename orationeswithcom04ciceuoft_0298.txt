potes,’ 810. The text means then ‘as to
your blaming me for defending too many
persons.' Cicero, as he says in his letters to
Quintus (ii. 16; iii. 33 referred to by &Vun-
der), was very busy at this time.

maintains that it is necessary. The mean-
ing of the sentence is this, whether we ac-
cept ‘ in’ or reject it: ‘ But it is the conse-
quence of the scrupulousness of such men
as you, who, after well weighing your cases,
reject nearly all, that most of them crowd
to me.’

Creta] Laterensis having been in Creta,
reminds Cicero that he had missed the occa-
sion of a joke about his candidateship, for
the ‘ candidati ’ wore 111-05505 cleaned or
whitened for the occasion. Garatoni refers
to Persius (v. 177), ‘cretata ambitio‚’ and
to the passage in Livy (iv. 25, quoted in
the Introduction to this oration). If Late-
rensis said what Cicero attributes to him, and
we must suppose that he did, he was a
trifler, and the master of rhetoric paid him

off well.

' The Schol. Ambros. has a wonderful note
here. He says: “ et solebant omnes can-
didati alba creta obliniri cervicem ut populo
notabiliores essent.'' This makes even
Garatoni merry3 and among other things
he asks‚ Why not whiten their faces ? But
he mistook the colour. Black would have
suited most of them best.—‘ cupidior
dicti ι’ ‘ fonder of saying smart things!

Te aiebas] The Schol. Ambros. ex-
plains this. Laterensis said that he sent
no despatches to Rome. We may infer
from this that in Bithynia or elsewhere he
had held a command. He did not send
⁴1itterae‚' because he knew by experience
that Cicero's ‘ litterae’ to a certain person
had done him harm. The allusion is to a
long letter (ad instar voluminis scriptam)
about his consulship, sent by Cicero to
Cn. Pompeius when he was in Asia. This
letter does not exist. Τ110 great man was

oti'ended at the arrogance which this bulky
letter contained. This letter is mentioned
in the oration Pro Sulla, 0. 24, and the
note. This big letter of Cicero is the occa-
sion osone of Garatoni’s big notes, which
after all is worse than useless, if he has
failed 111 his attempt to prove that the
Scholiast is wrong when he says of this
letter, “ aliquanto, ut videbatur, insolentius
scriptam, ut Pompei stomachum non medio-
criter commoveret—Obfuerunt autem ⁷re
vera; nam sic effectum est, ut ei Pompeius
contra Clodianam vim non patrocinaretur.’'
Wunder maintains that Cicero did damage
himself by this letter, and this is a correct
conclusion from Cicero's own writiugs.
Pompeius had indeed other reasons for
being cool with Cicero somewhat later; but
the tone in which he replied to Cicero
shows how he took the big letter; perhaps
he treated it as such letters should be
treated. Cicero (Ad Div. v. 7, addressed
to Pompeius) says, “Ad me autem litteras
quas misisti, quamquam exiguam significa-
tionem tuae erga me voluntatis habebant,
tamen mihi scito jucundas fuisse.” The
great man wrote coldly after the receipt of
this letter, but his flatterer was not to be
rebuffed so easily. He returns to the
charge: ‘⁴ Res eas gessi, quarum aliquam in
tuis litteris et nostrae necessitudinis et rei
publicae caussa gratulationem expectavi,
quam ego abs te praetermissam esse arbitror,
quod vererere ne cujus animum offenderes.''
There was not a word of congratulation in
the general’s answer from Asia to the long
letter. The last part of this chapter is an
admission that this letter did Cicero barm,
for it failed to secure him the support of
Pompeius against the men who from the
time of Cicero’s consulship were planning
his ruin. The great man on his return
affected a show of friendship to Cicero for a
time (Philipp. ii. c. 5; De Off. i. 22), but
he was never sincere, not more sincere than
Cicero.
