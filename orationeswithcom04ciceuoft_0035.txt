CAP. 5, 6. 153
hominis doctissimi nomen tuis immanibus et barbaris moribus prae-
tendere, quae te tanta pravitas mentis tenuerit, qui tantus furor,
ut, quum inaudita ac nefaria sacra susceperis, quum inferorum
animas elicere, quum puerorum ext-is deos manes mactare soleas,
auspicia, quibus haec urbs condita est, quibus omnis res publica
atque imperium tenetur, contempseris, initioque tribunatus tui
senatui denuntiaris, tuis actionibus augurum responsa atque ejus
collegii arrogantiam ‘impedimento non futura? Secundum ea
” quaero servarisne 111 eo fidem? num quando tibi moram attulerit
quo minus concilium advocares legemque ferres, quod eo die scires
de caelo esse servatum? Et quoniam hic locus est unus quem tibi
cum Caesare communem esse dicas, sejungam te ab illo, non solum
rei publicae caussa, verum etiam Caesaris, ne qua ex tua summa

the word only in the phrase ⁴ sacra suoci-
pere.' It was, he says, “ forma antiqua et
in rebus sacris poni solita ;” and he quotes
Festus, p. 321, Muell. and Wagner, Orthog.
Vergil. p. 473.-‘inferorum animas τ’ this
was one of the impudent pretenoes of the
nommanoers‚ to bring the dead up, as
described in Horace, Sat. i. 8 (Abrami);
who, as Halm observes, after his fashion

¹ has collected heaps of matter about this

superstitious practice. Halm refers to Varro,
quoted by Augustin, de Civit. viii. 25, who
saysthat Pythagoras smdied necromancy,
aud that the art was brought from Persia.
Likely enough. The east is the fertile
mother of superstition.

puerorum extis] Abi-ami observes that
Pythagoras could not be charged with this,
for he killed nothing that had h‘fe. Gre-
gorius of Nazianzus and others accused
Julian the emperor of doing this3 which
is an invention of their own. Juvenal, Sat.
vi. ⁵5⁰, says,

‘⁸ —- Armenius vel Commagenus haruspex
Pectora pullorum rimabitur, exta mtelli,
Interdum et pueri.”

Ammianus (xxix. 2) tells a story of one
Pollentianus‚ a tribunus in the time of
Valens, cuning open a pregnant woman and
taking the child out for the purpose of
calling up the manas to know if there was
to be a change 111 the empire. Lindenbrog
in his note quotes a like story about the
Emperor Maxentius from Eusebius (nist.
Eedoeviii. 214), andhealsotellsthe
story about Julian, giving his authorities.
mactare] ⁴ to appease ’ or ‘plenseJ—‘ au-
spica? Bibulus the consul, Caaeu’s col-
leugae, is said ‘servasse de oaelo,' iu order

to prevent the Leges of Caesar from benig
carried, but Caesar and Vatinius car-ed not
for his relig-lons objections (Sueton.Julius, c.
20). See De Lege Agraria, ll. 12, note
on ‘auspicia’ Rome was founded under

¹the auspicia: “ qua gloria parta urbem

auspicato condere et firmare dicitur (Romu-
lus) primum cogitavisse rem publicam '’
(Cicero, de Re Publica ii. 3, and 9). Every
thing was done at Rome with a relig-ious
(ιω-0111011181. The safety of the state de-
pended on the observant-e of relig-jons forms.
Machiavelli (Discorsi. i. c. 1-2) has examined
this matter and placed in contrast the
Roman strict observances of religion with
the neglect of their religion by the Chris-tiens,
to which neglect of the Church of Rome he
ascribes the ruin of Italy.

fidem] He asks if he kept his promise.
He means that he did.—⁴ de eaelo servarum :’
see De Domoy c. 15, note—⁴ hic locus est
unus :‘ ‘ de auspiciis neglectis ’ (Halm). who
says that Osiander (see Vol. iii. Index)
ought to hare translated ⁴ quem . . dicas’
thus, ⁴ von dem du etwa behaupten konn-
testx Ι suppose this unlucky translator
missed tbe meaning of the subjunctive in
his version. OEoero does not say ⁴ quem
dieis.' ⁴ which you say‚‘ but he says. ⁴ this is
the only matter in which you ean say.'

rei publicae caussa] For it would cause
disturbanoe, says Govmus. if the Leges of
Caesar should be declax-ed null for informs
airy, particularly his Agraria Lex—⁶ quod
facit Caesar ι’ Caesar had submitted his Lex
Agraria to the Senate for their appmbation
(Dion 38. c. 23 Sueton. (hem, c. 3⁴).
OEoem. who did not like the Lex. had ie
tired into the country to avoid being
present.
