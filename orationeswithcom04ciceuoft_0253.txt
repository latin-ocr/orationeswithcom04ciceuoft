posse mgffraqiis] Rome was in ancient
times the greatest example of a popular
governinent, and a more signal example
than any modern nation. The popular vote
was employed annually to elect the highest
magistrates in the State, who had thus the
opportunity of distinguishing themselves as
generals and administrator-s. The condition
ofa free people is one of restlessness‚ for
the active and ambitious having the road
open before them, crowd into it and stix· up
the voters to help them. Such a govern-
ment is a noisy‚ uneasy sort of thing, dis-
agreeable to quiet people, full of corruption,
and sometimes shaken by violent tempests,
but we must be content with it, or with
something like it, unless we would sink into
the dull leaden sleep which despotism flings
over the eyes of people, while it gags their
mouths and picks their pockets. Horace
lias something about the elections, though
in his time they were losing their signiti-
cance:

‘⁸ Hic multum in Fabia valet, ille Velina,
Cuilibet hic fasces dabit, eripietque curule
Cui volet importunus ebur.''

(Horace, Ep. i. 6, v. 52.)

jactemur] The best MSS. have the sub-
junctive, but Ernesti and others preferred
⁴ jactamur.⁷ The ‹litl'erence between ⁴ jacta-
mur ' and ¹ jactcmur’ is the samo that wa
find in innumerable like passages. The in-

dicative would say, ⁴ it is the business of us
who are tossed in this popular tempest and
ocean.’ The subjunctive would say, ‘it is
the business of men like ourselves. being
exposed to the popular tempest and ocean,
to be content with what the people choose.'
Since we are exposed to the storin, we must
make the best of it. KVunder remarks that:
many of those who now write Latin use the
word ‘ quum‚’ where the Romans would uso
‘ qui ’ with the subjunctive3 and this is
true. The men who write Latin now sel-
dom write it well.

M. Seium] we infer from this passage
that he had been convicted, and had paid a
penalty which reduced his fortune to a sum
below the amount required in a man of
equestrian rank. (Horace, Ep. i. l. V· 57·)
