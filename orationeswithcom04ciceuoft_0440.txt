418 ORAT. PRO Q. LIGARIO

dorem omnium, hanc Brocchorum domum, hunc L. Marcium, C.
Caesetium, L. Corfidium, hos omnes equites Romanos, qui adsunt,
veste mutata, non solum notos tibi, verum etiam probatos viros,
qui tecum fuerunt? Atque his irascebamur, hos requirebamus,
his nonnulli etiam minabamur. Conserva igitur tuis suos ut, quem-
admodum cetera quae dicta sunt a te, sic hoc verissimum reperia-
tur. Xli. Quod si penitus perspicere posses concordiam Ligari-
orum, omnes fratres tecum judicares fuisse. An potest quisquam
dubitare quin, si Q. Ligarius in Italia esse potuisset, in eadem sen-
tentia fuisset futurus, in qua fratres fuerunt? Quis est qui horum
consensum conspirantem et paene conflatum in hac prope aequali-
tate fraterna non noverit? qui hoc 11011 sentiat, quidvis prius futu-
rum fuisse quam ut hi fratres diversas sententias fortunasque seque-
rentur? Voluntate igitur omnes tecum fuerunt ς tempestate abrep-
tus est unus, qui si consilio id fecisset, esset eorum similis, quos tu
tamen salvos esse voluisti. Sed ierit ad bellum, dissenserit non a
te solum, verum etiam a fratribus. Hi te orant tui. Equidem
quum tuis omnibus negotiis interessem, memoria teneo qualis
T. Ligarius quaestor urbanus fuerit erga te et dignitatem tuam.

splendorem] ‘ Splendor ' was a. word making the usual lamentations roused him
appropriated to the ‘ equestris ordo’ to life, and he buried his younger brother
(Abrami). ⁴ who had given the orders for the funeral
Corfidium] ‘Cornifidium ' C. Some of (Pliny, N. H. vii. 0. 52).

the old commentators read ‘Cornificium.'
Abrami refers to a letter of Cicero (Ad Att.
xiii. 43) which shows that Corfidius was
dead when this speech was delivered, but
we might conclude from the word ‘ hunc'
that he was present. It was a curious
blunder: ‘⁴ Brutus mihi T. Ligarii verbis
nuntiavit quod appelletur L. Corfidius in
oratione Ligariana erratum esse meum;
sed ut aiunt μνημονικὸν ἁμάρτημα. Scie-
bam Corfidium pernecessarium Ligario-
rum, sed eum video ante esse mortuum.
Da igitur quaeso negotium Pharnaci, An-
taeo, Salvio, ut id nomen ex omnibus libris
tollatur.” Pharnaces and the rest were
‘librarii ' of Atticus, who had oihers also
whom Cicero mentions. They copied manu-
scripts for Atticus, and he made money by
the business. We may perhaps owe a good
deal to him for multiplying copies and
giving Cicero's 1101115, and particularly his
letters, a better chance of preservation. <Ne-
pOS‚ Life of Atticus, c. 13.) The cunning
fellow has taken care that we have no letters
of his own. This Corfidius may be the man
who was supposed to be dead, and all the
arrangements had been made for his fune-
ral, but the noise of the people who were

veste mutata] See Index, Vol. iv. Halm
explains ‘qui tecum fuerunt’ to mean
‘ who had not joined Pompeius ;’ for if they
had been on Caesar‘s side, Cicero would
have magnified this merit in very different
terms.

requirebamus] We looked for them and
did not find them. There is a reading

fucrit,y the reading of many printed books,
and of Baiter.—‘ non noverit?' ‘noverit‚
qui hoc non sentiat,’ Baiter, following
Theod. Hansing, and not the MSS.

Sed ierit . . . dissenserit] ⁴ But suppose
that he did go to Africa to fight against
you,’ that he did belong to the opposite
party. ‘ Dissenserit ' seems abetter reading
than ‘ discesserit,' the other reading.

quaestor urbanus] Cicero helps us 1ο
fix the time of Ligarius' quaestorship by
dexterously reminding Caesar that he was
active in all his interests. The time then
may be, as Fabritius suggests, B-C. 56,
when Caesar got money from the ‘aera-
rium’ for his Gallio campaign (De Prov.
Cons.). The ‘quaestores urbani’ had the
care of the ‘aei-arium,' and kept the ac-
