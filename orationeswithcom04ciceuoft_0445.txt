c. 34). Calvinus was defeated by Pharnaces near Nicopolis, and a great
part of Deiotarus' men were killed. But the master of the art of war,
having got out of his dangerous position in Egypt, was approaching
through Syria and Cappadocia. Deiotarus met Caesar on the borders of
Galatia in the dress and fashion of a suppliant. Caesar gave him back
his royal attire, and said that he would afterwards settle the disputes
among the tetrarchs. Deiotarus joined Caesar with his forces against
Pharnaces, and after the defeat of this king at Zela, Caesar marched
through Galatia and Bithynia into Asia, where he settled the questions
in dispute about all these provinces. He gave to Mithridates of Per-
gamum, for his services in the Alexandriae war, Pharnaces' kingdom of
Bosporus and the tetrarchy of the Trocmi, which he took from Deio-
tarus. Caesar also took from Deiotarus, and gave to Ariobarzanes of
Cappadocia the Less Armenia, or part of it (Dion 41, c. 63).

At the close of B.c. 45, after Caesar’s return from Spain, Castor, the
son of Deiotarus’ daughter, accused his grandfather of having designed
to assassinate Caesar, when he was Deiotarus’ guest in Galatia, after
the defeat of Pharnaces iu Pontus, The Schol. Gronov„ who has written
an inaccurate argument to this speech, says that Deiotarus was in-
triguing to get back part of his kingdom (quomodo perveniret ad par-
tem regni), and that upon this his son-in-law sent persons to Rome to
accuse Deiotarus of having plotted against Caesar’s life. Halm thinks
that the Scholiast’s statement is improbable, and that this alone would
not account for such a proceeding. I do not see the improbability of it.
Brutus had already spoken in behalf of Deiotarus before Caesar at
Nicaea, in Bithynia (13.0. 47. Cicero, Brutus, c.5; Ad Att. xiv. 1). Cac-
sar, as already observed, left Galatia before making any decision about
the disputes among the tetrarchs, and Brutus probably spoke at Nicaea
in behalf of Deiotarus’ tetrarchy of the Trocmi and his kingdom of
Armenia. The king would no doubt wish to recover what he had lost,
and for this purpose would continue to prosecute his claims with Caesar.
How these claims interfered with the interests of his son-in-law or
grandson, we do not know. However this may be, Deiotarus and his
family were not on good terms, and the quarrel was about power and
property.

We aro informed that Deiotarus turned Brogitarus, another son-in-
law, out of possession of the priesthood of Pessimus, which he had got
from P. Clodius (De lIarusp. Resp. e. 13, Vol. iii.); but this took place
before Caesar was in Galatia. The king is also said to have put to death
the rest of his sons in order to secure his possessions to one of them.
He also is said to have put to death his own son-in·law‚ and his daughter;
but the time is not ascertained. If Tarcondarius Castor, who sent uid
to Pompeius, and sent his own son also, before the battle of Pharsalus,
