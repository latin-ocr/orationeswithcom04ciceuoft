tate rei publicae, sed quum spe, tum timore moderari ἓ Quod si quis
de contentione principatus laborat, quae nulla esse debet, stultis-
sime facit. si vitiis cuin virtute contendit: ut enim cursu cursus, sic
in viris fortibus virtus virtute superatur. Tu, si ego de re publica
optime sentiam, ut nie vincas ipse pessime senties? aut, si ad me
bonorum concursum fieri v‚idebiS ad te improbos invitabis? Nollem,
primum rei publicae caussa deinde etiam ᾀὲῗιιϊπω tuae. Sed si
principatus ager-·‚et¹n quem numquam ex'peti 1 quid tandem mihi
esset optatius. 2 Eoo enim malis sententiis vinci non possum, bonis
forsitan possum, et libenter. Haec populum Romanum videre, anim-
advertere, judicare quidam moleste serunt. Poteratne fieri ut
non proinde homines de quoque ut quisque mereretur judicarent?
Ut enim de universo senatu populus Romanus verissime judicat,
nullis rei publicae temporibus hunc ordinem firmior em aut fortiorem
fuisse, sic (le uno quq 110 nostrum, et maxime qui 1100 1000 5011-
tentias dicimus sdisc gantur omnes, aise‘r‘i'tf audire, quid quisque
senserit; ita de uno quoque, ut quemque meritum arbitrantur, ex-
istimant. Memoria‘tenent me ante diem xnr. Kalendas Januarias

such bodies as a senate or parliament, or
chamber, particularly in times of danger.
Some are dishonest and false to the public
interest, some are perfectly careless‚ some
unsteady in their resolutioris, and regulate
their opinions, or their professed opinions,
not by the interest of the state, but by
their hopes or fears. In such a body Cicero
had to contend against Antonius, and the
cunning of Caesar, the treachery of Lepidus
and Plancus, and the legions of Rome.

Nollem] “meix nolim Orelli cum cod.
Huydec.'' (Halm.) Cicero means that it
had been so; that this person whom he ad-
dresses, or the person whom he means, had
used dishonourable means ; aud he says
‘ nollem‚’ ‘ I am sorry for it!

qnid . . . optatius] ⁴* Quam ut me vin-
035 ” (Manutius). I think he has not seen
the sense of the passage. Klotz has rightly
explained it. Cicero begins (‘ Quod si ') by
supposing that there may be a struggle for
the Principatm, and he says that to strive
with 1100 against virtue is absurd. If
Cicero has right opinions about the state,
must his adversary attempt to get the ad-
vantage over him by wrong opinions ? Both

for the sake of the state and of the man’s
own character, he protests against this. He
begins again : But supposing the question to
be about the supremacy in the state- though
Cicero really never desired it—but supposing
the question to be this, what could Cicero
wish for more than that his opponent should
employ these dislionest means ? For in
such a contest Cicero could not be defeated
by a rival with such opinions; by 311 honest
man he might perhaps be defeated, and he
would be well content to be defeated.—
‘forsitan possum :' t 1135 ‘possum‚' Halm
has ⁶ possim?

proinde] “proinde t: perinde rell. mei et
Orelli'' (Halm), who prints ⁸ proinde.’ It
is not often that I have been able to dis-
cover ‘ proinde . . . ut ’ in the various read-
ings3 but it is perhaps the genuine form.
See Index, Vol. i. ⁴ proinde‚’ ⁴ perinde.'—
‘de quoque :’ ‘ de ' was added by Ferrarius.

anle diem xiil, Kal.] That is on the
xln. Kal. Jan.‚ the day on which the
Third Philippic was delivered. Ferrarius
wrote x111. (xnn mei, Halm).—‘ me ex
Kalendis Jan. :' see Phil. vi. c. l.
