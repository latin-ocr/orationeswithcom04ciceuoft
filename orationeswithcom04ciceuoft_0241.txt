should be continued till it was terminated. Ι (10 not think that this in-
terpretation is certain.

The Lex Tullia did not stop bribery. Plutarch, who followed
Roman authorities, and Cicero, who was writing at the time, speak of
large sums being spent at elections (Ad Att. i. 16, written B.c. 61).
Cicero mentions two Senatusconsulta made in B.c. 61 on the proposal of
M. Cato and Domitius to punish certain electioneering tricks: “unum
ut apud magistratus inquiri liceret3 alterum, cujus domi divisores habe-
rentur, adversus rem publicam (facere videri).’' The first Senatuscon-
sultum is supposed to mean that the houses of magistratus might be
searched, if there was suspicion of money being lodged there for the
purposes of bribery3 but this interpretation is at least doubtful.

The proposed Lex of the tr. pl. Aufidius Lurco (Cic. Ad Att. i. 16),
which was not enacted, looks very like a motion of some eccentric mem-
ber of the English Parliament. Aufidius proposed that if a candidate
promised money to the tribes for their votes and did not pay it, he
should not be punished3 but if he did keep his promise, he should bc
compelled to pay as long as he lived three hundred sestertii to each
tribe3 annually, we may suppose.

Votes at Rome were now all venal: neither the penalties imposed
on the bribers, nor the secret voting, prevented bribery. The ‘ confusio
suffragiorum’ which Servius Sulpicius rccommended, joined with the
ballot, might have rendered bribery more difficult; but the proposal of
Sulpicius was rejected, and the voters were not paid till they had given
their votes. Though there could be no certainty about the vote of an
individual, the vote of a tribus, οι· of a centuria, was certain, being the
vote of the majority, and it was immaterial to the candidate who voted
sor him or against him, if he could secure a majority. When he had
the vote of the tribus, his agents would accordingly distribute a sum of
money among all the voters of the tribus after the election. When a
people are so corrupt as to take money for their votes, there is no way
of preventing bribery. One of the great Roman bribcrs bought his way
to supreme power. O. Caesar bought votes for himself and for others.
He got the office of Pontifex Maximus by purchase, and ultimately tho
consulship and the government of Gallia. The great wealth and thc
great name which he got in his Gallio campaigns enablod him to make
himself master of Rome (Plut. Caesar, cc. 5, 7, 20; Sucton. Caesar,
c. 13). Even the Senate used bribery to protect their own party
against Cacsar. They helped Bibulus with money to secure his olco-tion
(13.0. 60), that they might have a consul to maintain their iuterests
against the inssuence of his colleague Cacsar (Suoton. c. 19).

In ΒΩ. 55, in tho second consulship of Cu. Pompeius, aud also iu tho
second consulship of M. Licinius Crassus, the Lex Licinia was proposed
