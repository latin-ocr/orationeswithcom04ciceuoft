490 ORAT. PHILIPPICARUM LIBER SECUNDUS.

Brutus pugionem Ciceronem nominatim exclamavit atque ei recu-
peratam libertatem cst gratulatus. Cur mihi potissimum? quia
sciebam? Vide ne illa caussa fuerit appellandi mei, quod, quum
rein gessisset consimilem rebus iis quas ipse gesseram, me potissi-
mum testatus est se aemulum mearum laudum exstitisse. Tu
autem, omnium stultissime, non intelligis, si id, quod me arguis
voluisse interfici Caesarem, crimen sit, etiam laetatum esse morte
Caesaris crimen esse? Quid enim interest inter suasorem facti et
probatorem, aut quid refert utrum voluerim fieri an gaudeam fac-
tum? Ecquis est igitur, exceptis iis qui illum regnare gaudebant,
qui illud aut fieri noluerit aut factum improbarit? Omnes ergo in
culpa3 etenim omnes boni quantum in ipsis fuit Caesarem occi-
derunt. Aliis consilium, aliis animus, aliis occasio defuit, voluntas
nemini. Sed stuporem hominis vel dicam pecudis attendite, sic
enim dixit: Brutus, quem ego honoris caussa nomino, cruentum
pugionem tenens, Ciceronem exclamavit, ex quo intelligi debet eum
conscium fuisse—Ergo ego sceleratus appellor a te, quem tu sus-
picatum aliquid suspicaris3 ille, qui stillantem prae se pugionem
tulit, is a te honoris caussa nominatur? Esto: sit in verbis tuis
hic stupor; quanto in rebus sententiisque major. Constitue hoc,
consul, aliquando, Brutorum, C. Cassii, Cn. Domitii, C. Trebonii,

caussae indormientem?

12. Ciceronem nominatim] Calenus, in
his speech against Cicero (Dion, 46, c. 22),
says: “ When the conspirators ran into the
Forum with their bare swords, they re-
peatedly called on Cicero by name, crying
out, O Cicero, as I think all of you heard.’⁷
But this compiler’s speech is his own
making.

quas ipse gesseram] In his consulship,
in the matter of the conspirators. But the
likeness is not very striking—⁴ laudum ε’
‘ 1audium,' V. Halm.—⁴ laetatum esse:’ he
did rejoice, as he often tells us in these ora-
tions and in his letters (Introd.).

consilium] ‘prudence or skill in con-
triving.' ⁴ Nemini,' as usual in such sen-
tences comes at the end. Caesar places the
word ‘ nulli' so (B. G. ii. c. 35). ⁴ Stuporem’
is ⁴ stupidity.' He calls him ⁴ pecus,’ ⁴ beast‚'
as he calls P. Clodius and others.

honoris caussa] See Phil. i. c. 2, and
Index, Vol. ii.

hic stupor] Antonius is represented by
Plutarch as a rough soldier, course and

rather dull. Speaking of his conduct in
Asia, Plutarch says (e. 24), “ Antonius was
ignorant of the greater part of what was
going on; and not so much because he was
indoleat, as because in his simplicity he
trusted those about him. For there was
in his character simplicity and slow percep-
tions ’² (Antonius, c. 24). Plutarch’s bio-
graphy of Antonius is one of the best pic-
tures of character that ever was written.

quam velis esse caussam] ¹ Bonam an
malam' (Manutius).-‘ crapulam ι’ Anto-
nius is charged by Cicero with beastly
drunkenness. He was a slave to wine and
women.—⁴ exhala2' ‘exala ’ V, b, t, Halm.
“Romanus A. i. 417 alant, h a recentiore
manu supra scripta. Anhelum Vatic. Aen.
vi. 48, halitus idem Aen. iv. 684. vi. 240 ”
(Wagner).

[te]] ‘te om. V! (Halm); and it is
perhaps better to omit it. He represents
the consul as dead drunk, and asks if no-
thing short of a blazing lightfituck in his
face will stir him up.
