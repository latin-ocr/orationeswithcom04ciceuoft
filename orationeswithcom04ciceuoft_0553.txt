INTRODUOTION TO THE THIRD PHILIPPIG.

AETER his speech of the 2nd of September (p. 457), Cicero did not
appear in the senate until the 20th of December, when he delivered
his Third Philippic. It appears from one of his letters (Ad Div. xii. 2)
that he was in Rome on the leth of September, on which day Antonius
made his fierce attack on Cicero (Introd. to the Second Phil.). It ap-
pears also from other letters (Ad Div. xii. 3) that he was in Rome on
the 2nd of October, when M. Antonius addressed the people3 and he
was there on the 9th of October, when Antonius set out to Brundisium
to meet the four legions from Macedonia (Ad Div. xii. 23). It does
not appear whether he was in Rome all the time between the 2nd of
September and the ath of October. However, he went into the country
after the 91:11 of October, and corresponded with Atticus (Ad Att. xv.
13), and also with Caesar, who was then raising troops in Campania.
While Cicero was in the country, he was occupied with writing and
looking out for his safety by keeping out of Antonius' way.

The quarrel of M. Antonius and Caesar was made worse by Antonius
charging Caesar with hiring men to assassinate him (Ad Div. xii. 23).
Cicero says that most people thought that Antonius invented the charge
in order that he might have a pretext for not settling accounts with
Caesar3 but the sensible and respectable part (‘ prudentes et boni ⁸), of
whom he was one, believed. the charge to be true and approved of the
act. But no proof of the charge was produced. Appian (B. O. iii. 39)
says that afew, who judged more truly, saw that it was Caesar's interest
that Antonius should live, though he had wrongcd Caesar, sor he was
formidable to the Dictator's assassins, and that if Antonius were dead,
they would dare to do any thing, especially as they were supported by

the senate. This is a sensible remark.
The vcterans seem to have suspected that Antonius was not so zealous

in avenging the Dietator's death, as hc pretended and they wished, and
it was necessary for him to convince them that it was not so. Accord-
ingly he set up the Dictator’s statue on the Rostra with the inscription
“ Parenti optime merito.'’ On the 2nd of October he addressod thc
people, and told them that the Liberators were traitors, that they had
done every thing on the advice of Cicero, and that the tribune Ti. Canu—
tius, an enemy of Ant-onius, was a tool of Cicero. Antonius searing
