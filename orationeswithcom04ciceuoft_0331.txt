sentence, which are included in [ ] are ‘hiemum,’ and Halm accepts it. Halm

supposed by Weiske to be the addition of
some ‘ homo ineptus.' These ‘ inepti ’ have
doubtless stuffed a good deal of their own
into Cicero’s text.

This sentence is not easy. The ‘medio-
cris virtus ¹ is the merit of Postumus:
‘ Unless indeed it is possible for this to be
the result of a small degree of merit, that
so great a man should value this defendant
so highly, especially when he is both unfor-
tunate and a long way from him, and when
his own fortune is so exalted that to have
reg-ard to another man’s condition is a great
thing, and when he is so busily employed
about the most important matters that to
forget others would be nothing strange.'
The difficulty is ‘et in tanta fortuna sua, ut
aliena . . . non sit mirum) The ‘ ut aliena
respicere magnum sit ' depends on ‘ in tanta
1011111111,ν and the difficulty is to find aproper
expression for ‘in tanta fortuna sua.' The
first part of the sentence ends at ‘ et absen-
tem! ⁴ Et in tanta fortuna sua ’ means
⁴ when his own condition is so exalted that
it is a great thing for him to have regard to
other people's.' The other part of the sen-
tence is explained the same way.

Castris locum capere] Cicero uses these
words to signify the selection of a place for
encampment, like his friend Caesar, B. G. iii.
23, “loca capere, castra munire.'¹——‘hanc
vim frigorum :' Cicero is speaking in the

winter-time. Patricius proposes to read

also writes ‘iis ipsis ε’ the MSS. have ‘ his,'
plainly the true reading.

In the winter of B.c. 54 Caesar was fully
employed. His Legati Sabinus and Cotta
with their troops were slaughtered in the
country of the Eburones, and Cicero’s bro-
ther Quintus was besieged in his camp in
the country of the Nervii. Caesar hurried
to the relief of Quintus and defeated the
enemy (B. G. v. 26-52). Cicero, writing
to his brother in Belgium during the winter,
says z “ Tu velim cures ut seiani quibus nos
dare oporteat eas quas ad te deinde literas
mittemus, Caesarisne tabellariis ut is ad te
protinus mittat, an Labieni ; ubi enim
sunt isti Nervii et quam longe absint nescio''
(Ad Q. Fr. iii. 8). Labienus was on the
borders of the Treviri. Caesar was pro-
bably at Samarobriva (Amiens) when he
heard of Q. Cicero being blockuded in the
country of the Nervii. Cicero had certainly
received a letter from Quintus, in which he
had been infor-med that Caesar had placed
Quintus for the winter in the country of tho
Nervii (Β. G. v. 24). It was the usual
practice in war to be quiet in winter. This
is what he means by ‘jure gentium)

sempiternmn] The codd. are said to
have ⁴ sempiterna! Halm, following Mad-
vig, writes ‘svd magnis excitantur prae-
miis ac memoria hominum sempiterna.¹
