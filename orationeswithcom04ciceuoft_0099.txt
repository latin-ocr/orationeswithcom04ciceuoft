A Mimus was a coarse farce, where the
gesture was indecent and the imitation was
of coarse things. Valerius Maximus (ii. 6,
7) says of the Massilienses z “ Eadem civitas
severitatis custos acerrima est; nullum adi-
tum in scenam Mimis dando, quorum argu-
menta majore ex parte stuprorum continent
actus, ne talia spectandi consuetudo etiam
imitandi licentiam sumat.’' This passage
is cited by John of Salisbury (Nugae, viii. c.
2) with a little variation, ⁴ mimis daret in
caena! They ended with some coarse piece
of acfing, as he says here; by some one
making his escape from the stage : then
comes the rattling of the scabella. Salma-
sius (In Flav. Vop. p. 502) says that the
scabellum or scabillum ‘⁵ instrumentum erat
in modum scabelli ex ligno factum, vel sca-
bellum potius erat revera, hoc est ὑποπόδιον,
quod pede feriebatur cum lignea aut ferrea
solea ut major ederetur crepitus.’' There is
in the Louvre (383, Salle de la Psyche) a
dancing Faun: “il tient sous le pied droit
le scabillum, espece d'instrument creux en
forme de sandale, entre les semelles de la-
quelle 11 y avait des crotales ou castagnettes
qui servaient a marquer la mesure '' (Cla-
rac’s Louvre).

aulaeum tollitur] The curtain is raised3
the farce is ended. Horace (Ep. ii. l, v. 189)

“ Quatuor aut plures aulaea premuntur in
horas.''

‘Aulaea pi·emuntur‚' ‘ the curtain is let
down,' when the acting begins, and raised
when itis over. Ovid (Met. iii. 111) hasa
passage in which he compares the men

rising out of the earth from the seed of the
serpents' teeth to the appearance of the
figures on the ‘ aulaea,’ when they are raised.

It was a ease in which there was nothing to
lead to a conclusion except the direct evi-
dence of the witnesses, and they were not
yet examined. This chapter and other pas-
sages of Cicero show that the witnesses were
examined after the speeches. The words
⁴ nullus exitus criminis ' must be compared
with the beginning of c. 27. The translation
is not easy. The ⁸ crimen ’ or charge had
no ¹ exitus ς’ it concluded with nothing. sor
it ended with a story of a man going to do
something and making his escape before hc
was detected, though all pains had been
taken to detect him and seize him, and no-
body can tell why it was not done, if the
rest of the story was true.
