242 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

patruo, cum affinibus, cum propinquis, cum hoc On. Saturnino,
ornatissimo viro? cujus quantam honoris hujus cupiditatem fuisse
creditis, quum videtis luctus societatem? Quid de me dicam, qui
mihi inhujus periculo reus esse videor? quid de his tot viris tali-
bus, quos videtis veste mutata? Atque haec sunt indicia solida,
judices, et expressa, haec signa probitatis, nou fucata forensi specie,
sed domesticis inusta notis veritatis. Facilis est illa occursatio et
blanditia popularis: aspicitur, non attrectatum procul apparet,
non excutitur [non in manus sumitur]. Omnibus igitur rebus orna-
tum hominem tam externis quam domesticis, nonnullis rebus infe-
riorem quam te, generis dico et nominis, superiorem aliis, muni-
cipum, vicinorum, societatum studio, temporum meorum memoria,
parem virtute, integritate, modestia, aedilem factum esse miraris?

Hunc tu vitae splendorem maculis aspergis istis? J acis adulteria,
quae nemo non modo nomine, sed ne suspicione quidem possit

Cn. Saturnino] Cn. Apuleius Saturninus
was the son of Lucius (c. 8).—⁴ videtis luc-
tus :' ⁴ videatis codd. praeter T. E. omnes’
(Baiter). ‘⁴ Tenendumst autem cum par·
ticulam quotiens eo quod significet, id quod
saepe significat, necessario indicativom ad-
sciscere'' (Wunder), who gives many exam-
ples. But there is no reason to explain
⁴ quum ' by ⁴ eo quod.y It means ⁴ when.'
One of Wunder's examples is from this ora-
tion, c. 32 : ⁴⁴ Atqui haec quum vides, quo
me tandem,’⁷ &tu There is no doubt that
⁴ quum ’ in both these passages means ⁴ by
the fact of;’ but our word ⁴ when ' ex=
presses it well, or the participial form may
do sometimes

Atque haec sunt San] ⁴ Atqui,’ Wunder,
who thinks that ‘indicia' is not genuine,
and that the ⁴ haec’ before ⁴ signa' should
be omitted 3 buthe admits that all the MSS,
agree in giving what is in the text. He
objects to ‘indicia . . . solida et expressa,'
for ⁴ solida ' means that which cannot be
broken or destroyed, and ⁴ expressa' is ap-
plied to forms made in wax, clay, or plaster.
He admits that both 4 solida ’ and ‘ expressa ³
can be applied to things not in the con-
crete, but he objects that it is not probable
in itself nor can it be proved by any example
that both adjectives together are used
metaphorically; much less can it be proved
that ⁴ indicia ' are evercalled either ‘ solida ⁷
or ‘ expressa,' but on the contrary ⁴ signa’
and words of like signification are called ‘so-
lida ' and ‘expressa’ This is an example ofa
kind of discussion in which Wunder often
indulges. 1 have not given all that he says,
and if the reader wishes to know more

about it, he must read the editor's long
note. Ι (10 not set the slightest value on
it. Cicero's metaphors will not always bear
examination. When he uses ‘ solidus ' and
⁴ expressus ' with ⁴ signa’ or ‘effigies‚’ he
means figures in the round. Here ⁴ fucata,’
as Wunder observes, corresponds to 4 signa
expressa,' and ‘domesticis inusta notis veri-
tatis ’ corresponds to ⁴ solida) Thus all is
in perfect order, he supposes, if we get rid
of ⁴ iudicia ’ and the second 4 haec!

The expression ‘domesticis inusta notis
veritatis,’ is one of Cicero's metaphors that
we hardly know how to deal with. There
is also the expression ⁴domesticis notis
veritatis,' on which form Ι have remarked
before. (In Pison. c. 40, note 011 ⁴ domes—
ticum judicium.’)

non in manus sumitur] Wunder places
these words also in [] because they are
only an explanation of ‘non attrectatu1·,'
for ‘attrectare ’ signifies to take into the
hands or to handle. He is the first critic
who has stumbled at the words ‘non iu
manus,' &c.‚ and his remark is good.

qenerz‘s dico et nominis] This genitive
has puzzled the critics. Baiter, often in-
judicious, takes Garatoni's ‘genere dico et
nomine.' Baiter has this remark, “Qui
ablativum suppleverunt diqnitale vel splen-
dore vel decore non cogitaverunt, ad vv.
nonnullis rebus saltem duo substantiva ap-
ponenda fuisse ;’' which is a very absurd
remark. But I believe that Wunder is
right, who says that the text is genuine.

nomine] This refers to the word ‘bi-
maritum,' a man who is the husband of
two women; we may conclude, says
