CAP. 13-15, 685

igitur aequius, utrum me'lius rei publicae fuit, Cn. Pompeium an
sectorem Cn. Pompeii vivere Antonium? Qui vero praetorii!
quorum princeps M. Cat0, idemque omnium gentium virtute prin-
ceps. Quid reliquos clarissimos viros commemorem? Nostis omnes.
Magis vereor ne longum me in enumerando quam ne ingratum in
praetereundo putetis. Qui aedilicii ! qui tribunicii ἔ qui quaestorii!
Quid multa? Talis senatorum et dignitas et multitudo fuit ut
magna excusatione opus iis sit, qui illa in castra non venerunt.
XV. N unc reliqua attendite. ⁶ Victum Ciceronem ducem habuistis?
Eo libentius ‘ ducem' audio, quod certe ille dicit invitus; nam de
victo nihil laboro. Fatum enim meum est sine re publica nec vinci
posse nec vincere. ⁶ Macedoniam munitis exercitibus? Et quidem
fratri tuo, qui a vobis nihil degenerat, extorsimus, ‘ Africam com-
misistis Varo bis capto.' Hic cum Caio fratre putat se litigare.
‘In Syriam Cassium misistis? Non igitur sentis huic caussae orbem
terrae patere, te extra munitiones tuas vestigium ubi imprimas non
habere? ‘Cascam tribunatum gerere passi estis? Quid ergo? ut
Marullum, ut Caesetium a re publica removeremus eum per quem,
ut neque idem hoc posthac neque multa hujusmodi accidere pos-
sent consecuti sumus? ⁹ Vectigalia Juliana Lupercis ademistis?
Lupercorum mentionem facere audet? neque illius diei memoriam

tribunes were also excluded from the senate-
He tells the story with some additions to
what Suetonius says. Dion also has a

who often rejects the pronoun ‘hic,’ where

it seems to me that it should stand.
M. Cato] This is he of Utica, who well

merits Cicero's praise; a stubborn, dis-
agreeable sellow, but an honest man.

15. attendite] See Vol. i. Index.-—‘ mu-
nitis exercitibus :⁹ Ι have not seen ‘muni-
tus' used thus. Cicero may have left out
something, or Antonius may be writing
after his fashion.—¹ fratri tuo:' C. Anto-
nius.

Varo] Perhaps this is Sex. Quintilius
Varus, whom Caesar took at Corfinium in
B.c. 49, and let him loose. Varus crosscd
over to Africa where he served under P.
Atius Varus against C. Curio.-—· Caio fratre
. . . litigare :' Antonius is disputing with
the senate as he would with his brother
Caius, and has no respect for us (Ma-
nutius).

Cascam] Servilius Casca, one of Caesar’s
assassins.——-‘ Marullum . . . Caesetium :' the
tribunes Marullus and Caesetius took from

⁸ C. Caesar’s statue a bay ‹ti-own, which a

man had put on it, and sent the man to
prison. Caesar deprived the tribunes of
their office (Plutarch, Cacsar. c. (il 3 Sueto-
nius, Caesar, c. 793 Dion Cassius 44, e. 9,
10). Appian (B. C. ii. 108) says that the

somewhat different story from Suetonius.
Reimarus (note to Dion) observes that Ap-
pian says the tribunes were banished. Ι
don’t know where he found this. I think
he must have misunderstood Appian's text.
When Cicero says, ‘ere publica remove-
remus,' he merely means to keep them out
of public offices and from all such employ-
ment as a citizen might aspire to.

Vectiyalt'a Juliana] ‘The senate ap-
pointed priests for the Lupercalia, a third
Sacerdotium, and named it Julium ' (Dion
44, c. 6). There were two sets of priests
already, the Quintiliani and Fabiani (Fes-
tus). Ferrarius thought that we ought to
write ‘Julianis‚’ but he would not venture
to do it against the MSS. 1 suppose Cae-
sar or the senate assigned some tunds to
the new Luperci, which Antonius calls
⁴ Vectigalia juliana! Manutius quotes from
Nonius a passage of a letter from Cicero to
young Cacsar, in which he says: ¹· Quum
constet Caesarem Lupercis id vectigal de-
disse.''

Lupercorum monstenem] See Introd.
