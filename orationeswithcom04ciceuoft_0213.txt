GAP. 25, 26. 191

Hac tu oratione non dubito quin illum jam escendentem in
currum revocare possis. XXVI. O tenebrae, lutum, sordes, o
paterni generis oblite, materni vix memor! ita nescio quid istuc
fractum, humile, demissum, sordidum, inferius etiam est quam ut
Mediolanensi praecone avo tuo dignum esse videatur. L. Crassus,
homo sapientissimus nostrae civitatis, spiculis prope scrutatus est
Alpes, ut, ubi hostis non erat, ibi triumphi caussam aliquam quae-
reret: eadem cupiditate vir summo ingenio praeditus C. Cotta
nullo certo hoste flagravit. Eorum neuter triumphavit3 quod
alteri illum honorem collega, alteri mors praeripuit. Iri-isa est abs te
paullo ante M. Pisonis cupiditas triumphandi, a qua te longe dixisti
abhorrere: qui etiamsi minus magnum bellum gesserat, ut abs te
dictum est, tamen istum honorem contemnendum non putavit. Tu,
eruditior quam Piso, prudentior quam Cotta, abundantior consilio,
ingenio, sapientia quam Crassus, ea contemnis, quae illi idiotae, ut
tu appellas, praeclara duxerunt. Quod si reprehendis, quod cupidi

26. paterni] On his father’s side he be-
longed to the noble family of the Calpurnii ;
on his mother's side he was of Gallie de-
scent. llere he says that Piso’s maternal
grandfather had been a praeeo or crier at
Mediolanum (Milan), though we have been
told that this Gaul Calventius settled at
Placentia. Manutius explains this, but his
explanation is not worth any thing.

L. Crassus] The great orator. His col—
league Q. scaevola the Pontifex prevented
Crassus from having atriumph which he de-
manded for destroying some robbers and
marauders in Gallia Citerior. C. Cotta is
the orator, the contemporary of P. Sulpicius,
both of whom are speakers in Cicero’s De
Oratore. The senate had granted him a
triumph, b t he died before the day came
from the elfects of an old wound (Asconius).
The story about Crassus destroying the
robbers is in the De Inventione (ii. c. 7).

In place of ‘spiculis’ G. has ‘speculis’ and
V. has ‘peculiis.’ Madvig says that the
‘lepos’ of the passage is obscured in the
common text. ‘⁸ Non prope scrutatus est
Crassus Alpes, scd plane perscrutatus; in-
epte autem additur in hac communi scru-
tandi significatione et: imagine instrumenti
nomem nam neque vere instrumento hujus
modi ulla scrutatio facta est, et: tamen si
facta esset, quo alio instrumento imperator
et milites uterentur nisi hastis? ln cod.
vat. scriptam exstat pec-ultis· (civitati-r pecu-
liis). Cicero scripserat: ‘specillis prope
scrutatus cst, ut prope pertineat. ad totum
hoc specillis scrutari. Lepide enim Cicero
Crassum non minus prope diligenter Alpes

scrutatum esse dicit quam medici specillis
vulnera scrutantur et num quid lateat, ten-
tent (sast mit szclen (Iurchqesuclzl).'’
(Madvig cited by Halm, Addend. et Corrig.)
Cicero might 1 suppose have written ‘spe-
cillis' if he likcd. A ‘specillum’ is a
probing instrument. Cicero does not say
‘spiculis plane perscrutatus,' but ⁴ prope‚’
because the Alps could not literally be ex-
amined like the h›les and corners in a
house. Nor is the addition of ‘spiculis'
inept, because no ‘scrutatio' was really
made with an instrument of this kind. A
real ‘ scrutatio ’ may be made with a spear,
or a sword, or a pole, according to the cir·
cumstances, as well as with a small instru-
ment called a ‘specillu1n3' and as this
⁴ scrutatio' was notreally made with ⁴ specilla’
nor with ‘spicula.' the obje‹·tion to one
word is an objection to both. If a ¹ scru-
tatio ’ was made, he asks what else could
the soldiers use than their spcars? The
implied conclusion is that ‘spiculis' is
superfluous and absurd. The answer to
thisis easy. Soldicrs don’t use ¹ spEcula '
for scrutation3 they use them for fighting.
If they are said to use ‘ spicula ' for scrutu-
tion, for finding out. their cnemies' lurking-
places, the addition of ‘ spicula* shows
their eagerness in the search.

M. Pisonis] M. Pupius Piso Calpurnia-
nus, who had a triumph for his victorio.- in
Spain, where he was propraetor. 'l'his l'iso
“maxime ex omnibus qni ante fuorunt
Graecis doctrinis eruditus tuit '⁹ (Brutus, r.
