INTRODUOTION. 381

nians to ereet a marble monument to the memory of Marcellus. Ser-
vius tells all this to Cicero in a letter (Ad Div. iv. 12). The terms in
which this excellent and aeeomplished man speaks of Marcellus, show
that he was esteerned by the best and wisest Roman of the age. Cicero
(Brutus, c. 71) says that Marcellus possessed every merit of an orator;
on which passage Drumann has this absurd remark: “The letter in
which Marcellus informs Cicero of his return to Rome, cannot be taken
as evidence of his belonging to the first class of orators.” What would
some of Cicero’s short letters prove, or a single letter, and one of the
worst? Why, that he wrote very carelessly, as many men do in their
short letters, even those who can write well.

F. A. Wolf declared this oration Pro Marcello to be spurious. Since
his time' the critics have had different opinions about it, but most of
them think that it is genuine. Mai published (1817) some fragments
of old Scholia on this oration, which fragments may be from the 00111-
mentary of Asconius 3 whence some conclude that it is certain that this
speech is the genuine work of Cicero, but those who conclude so have
got a conclusion ready in their head, and do not derive it from any pre-
mises. The conclusion is that the oration which we have was known to
this Seholiast, and that is all that we can conclude.

The speech Pro Ligario was delivered after the speech Pro Marcello
(Pro Ligario, c. 12). Plutarch has a story (Cicero, c. 39) about Caesar
and Ligarius, which is this: “It is said also that when Quintus Liga-
rius was under prosecution, because he had been one of Caesar’s ene-
mies, and Cicero was his advocate, Caesar said to his friends, ‘What
hinders us listening after so long an interval to Cicero's speech, since
the man has long been adjudged a villain and an enemy ?’ ’' Drumann
says there is no sense in this, if Cicero had spoken for Marcellus a few
months before, as he really had done3 and some critics would translate
διὰ χρόνου ‘ after some time‚' instead of ‘after so long an interval,' and
if such a translation will help them, there is no objection to it. I do
not see the want of sense in Plutarch’s remark about the long interval.
The speech for Marcellus was a speech of thanks3 that for Ligarius was
in the nature of a defence. But however people may judge of this
matter, we cannot use Plutareh’s anecdote as any evidence against the
genuineness of the speech for Marcellus.

,1 have not W'olf’s remarks on this speech, but Drumann quotes 501110
of them in a long note (Geschichte Rums, Vol. vi. 267), froin which we.
see that they are in the same style as his remarks 011 the seur spurious·
speeehes. “ This extant speecl1,’' says Druniann, “ which was admit-ml
by the old crities‚ is deelared by Wolf to be a Declamation of the time
of Tiberius. 110 fights against it with still weaker weapons than against
the Four.'' Real criticism has made little pregress in (lei-inan)¹ since
