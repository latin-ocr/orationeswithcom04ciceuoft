ORATIONUM PHILIPPICARUM

LIBER SEXTUS.

Ι. AUDITA vobis esse arbitror, Quirites, quae sint acta in senatu,
quae fuerit cujusque sententia. Res enim ex Kalendis ‚Ianuariis
agitata paullo ante confecta est, minus quidem illa severe quam
decuit, non tamen omnino dissolute. Mora est allata bello, non
caussa sublata. Quamobrem quod quaesivit ex me P. Apuleius,
homo et multis officiis mihi et summa familiaritate conjunctus et
vobis amicissimus, ita respondebo ut ea quibus non interfuistis
nosse possitis. Caussa fortissimis optimisque consulibus Kalendis

appears from the Sixth Philippic (c. (ἶ)

passage shows that thc doors of the Tem-

the lst of January were open, and that
some of the people could hear what was
said, but as they could not all hear, Cicero
was introduced on the Rostra by the Tr. pl.
P. Apuleius, and told the people what had
been said. I don't think that this is tho
explanation of ‘ audita.' Ι suppose that
the people had heard in suine other way.
ex Kalendis] Beginning on the Ka-
lendae (Phil. xiv. c. 7).—‘ severe . . . disso-
lute ε’ these words are opposed. ‘ Tho
matter was settled less strictly than it ought
to have been, not however altogether ina

quaesivit] Perhaps it was the practice
for the Magistratus who brought sorward a
man to address the people, und it was neces-
sary that some Magistratus should do so,
to begin hy asking the man, as Cicero hcre
says, what had taken place in the senatc;
and on this hint he would spcak.
