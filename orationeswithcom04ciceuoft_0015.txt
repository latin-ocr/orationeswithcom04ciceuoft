PREFAGE. ix

so numerous, and sometimes so incorrectly stated, that in this
alone there is enough to perplex even a elever and diligent student.
Again, Cicero's argumentation is often so subtle that it is hard
to seize it; and since, as I have hinted, he does not always
intend to be plain, or to instruct, but to be obscure and to mis-
lead, it requires long practice to see what he means. Under
the simple easy form of Ciceros language there lurk difficulties
which some do not discover, and none can explain.

There are some orations which are comparatively easy, those in
which there is more of narrative, panegyric, and declamation.
They are for this reason the easiest for young students, but they
are not the best of Cicero's orations. There are some which are
so technical and difficult as to be quite unfit for school reading,
such as the orations Pro P. Quintio and Pro Caecina3 but a
young man at college may try his strength upon them. Other
orations are of a mixed character as to difficulty, simple in the nar-
rative, and perfectly clear in the argumentative part to a inan who
has studied them well, but very difficult to ordinary students. The
excellent orations Pro Cluentio and Pro Milone are of this kind.
I believe that all who have tried the experiment of reading these
two orations, even with intelligent youths of the age of eighteen,
must have found that there is a great deal in the argumentative
part which they do not readily apprehend; a great deal which no
commentator explains, or ought to explain; for if he explained all,
his work would be eudless, and also useless. It is in such cases as .
these that a man has a great advantage over a boy, and the teaclier's
business is to supply that which no commentator gives; and he
can do it sufficiently well, if he has a fair knowledge of the lan-
guage, and studies the lesson well before he hears it.

I shall make one suggestion, which may seem impertinent to
those who are not in need of it; but it may be useful to others.
We read an oration of Cicero or a Greek play bit by bit: we ex-
amine it as we go along, dissect it, and make a deinonstration on
the body. The process is necessary, in order that tlie student may
see each part well, and examine it minutely. But though this
troublesonie process is necessary in order to know what tlw thing
is, if we leave it after this operation in its disjected state, it is indeed
