ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM CAP. 1.

suffragio, nemo civitate, nemo luce dignum putet, nulla me caussa
impulisset, nisi ut ferocitatem istam tuam comprimerem, et auda-
ciam frangerem, etloquacitatem paucis meis interrogationibus
irretitam retardarem. Etenim debuisti, Vatini, etiamsi falso
venisses in suspicionem P. Sestio, tamen mihi ignoscere, si in
tanto hominis de me optime meriti periculo et tempori ejus et
voluntati parere voluissem. Sed hesterno pro testimonio esse
mentitum, quum affirmares nullum tibi omnino cum Albinovano
sermonem, non modo de Sestio accusando, sed nulla umquam de re
fuisse, paullo ante imprudens indicasti, qui et Τ. Claudium tecum
communicasse et a te consilium P. Sestii accusandi petisse, et
Albinovanum, quem antea vix tibi notum esse dixisses, domum
tuam venisse, multa tecum locutum dixe1·is; denique contiones P.
Sestii scriptas, quas neque nosset neque reperire posset, te Albino-
vano dedisse, easque in hoc judicio esse recitatas. In quorum
altero es confessus a te accusatores esse instructos et subornatos;

adds that ‘ hunc honorem . . ut ’ is different
from ‘ hunc honorem . . quod.' But Cicero
means that it was an ‘ honor’ to be ex-

amined, a mark of respect to a witness, and

, he tells Vatinius that his ‘ interrogatio ’ has

a different meaning.

nemo suffraqz'o] This might mean that
nobody thought him worthy to have the
‘ suffragium ;’ to which he adds ‘nor worthy
to be a citizen.’ It may also mean, if we 600-
nect ‘suffragium ' more immediately with
what precedes, that nobody thought him a
fit person to give his vote to, The context
seems clearly to show that the second is the
meaning. See 6. 16.-ι paucis meis :' ‘ pau-
cissimis‚' G. .

etiamsi salso] Sestius believed or said
that Vatinius combined with Albinovanus
in his prosecution of sestius (Introduction
to the oration Pro Sestio, Vol. iii.).—‘ tem·
pori ejus :' ‘his difficulty‚' or ι(1111161111 posi-
tion.' He says, ‘⁴ ut a nullius umquam me
tempore aut commodo aut otium mcum ab-
straxerit aut &c.” (Pro Archia, c. 6, Vol. iii.)

sed hesterno] ‘ Hesterno ' is to be taken
as an adverb, as Madvig says, like ¹ re-
pentino,' Pro P. Quintio, c. 4 ; Caesar, Β. G.
ii. 33. lt is a mistake to join it with ‘tes-
timonio.' The Romans said ‘pro testi-
monio,' which means ⁸ in the evidence ;' as
In Verr. ii. 4, c. 9, “ verum pro testimonio
dixisse.” Klotz compares the German ex-
pression ⁴ an zeugen statt,' ⁴ as a witness.’

tive in various ways.

The critics explain the nega-
Madvig calls it au

anacoluthon. There are many uses of nega-
tives which can bc brought under no rule.
VVhether we have ‘ulla’ or ‘nulla' the
same meaning is intended, and the same
sense must be given to the passage. Cicero
having said ‘ nullum . . serinoneni‚' would
or might have said ¹ ulla de re‚’ if no words
had been interposed; but it would be a
feeble form of expression, and his meaning
would not be so clear if 116 said ⁸ ulla de re,'
when these words are so far separated from
‘ nullum . . . sermonem! And this is the
meaning of Madvig's remark. who how-
ever says. that ‘sed nulla' is used on ac-
count of the words ‘non 1110(10;’ but I
think it might stand even if ‘non modo'
were not there, at least if it were separated
from ‘nullum sermonem ’ by any paren-
thetical masten—⁶ qui 61 ;’ ⁴ cum et,' 11111111.
