62 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO
Ex hoc genere illos fuisse arbitror, Camillos, Fabricios, Curios,
omnesque eos qui haec ex minimis tanta fecerunt. Verum haec
genera virtutum non solum in moribus nostris, sed vix jam in libris
reperiuntur. Chartae quoque, quae illam pristinam severitatem
continebant, obsoleverunt; neque solum apud nos, qui hanc sectam
rationemque vitae re magis quam verbis secuti sumus, sed etiam
apud Graecos, doctissimos homines, quibus, quum facere non
possent, loqui tamen et scribere honeste et magnifice licebat, alia
quaedam mutatis Graeciae temporibus praecepta exstiterunt.
Itaque alii voluptatis caussa omnia sapientes facere dixerunt, neque
ab hac orationis turpitudine eruditi homines refugerunt: alii cum
voluptate dignitatem conjungendam putaverunt, ut res maxime inter
se repugnantes dicendi facultate conjungerent. Illud unum
directum iter ad laudem cum labore qui probaverunt, prope soli

here and there, and for once are looked at

Christian. A passage of Seneca (Ep. 73)
out of curiosity. In Cicero's language every

also is quoted, and another (Ep. 41): ‘⁴ Prope

est a te Deus: tecum est3 intus est. lta
(1100, Lucili: sacer intra nos spiritus sedet,
malorum bonorumque nostrorum observator
et custos: 1110 prout a nobis tractatus est,
ita nos ipse tractat: bouus vir sine Deo
1101110 est. An potest aliquis 5111110 fortu-
nam nisi ab illo adjutus exsurgere ? ille dat
consilia magnifica et crecta.''

Eoe hoc {senet-e] This was a kind of ‘ locus
communis! These were the great worthjes
of Rome’s heroic age :

‘⁴ Gratus insigni referam Camena
Fabriciumque ε
Η11110 et incomptis Curium capillis
Utilem bello tulit et Camillum

Saeva paupertas.”
(Horace, Carm. i. 12.)

·—‘ qui haec ex minimis :’ who made Rome
great. The beginnings of Rome were very
small : that fact is certain. And she became
great and powerfu13 a proof that 1101· early
people were superior to their neighbours.
Chartae] ‘ writings‚’ ‘ books’ which
contained that antient strictness have be-
come obsoleta. It is not easy to say what
books he 11100115, perhaps 110110 at all. It is
merely a way of speaking ; for he says that
the Romans followed this way of life ‘re
magis quam verbis.r Some commentators
however find something appropriate in the
word ‘ chartae‚’ and as they may be rightv
they should be heard. Klotz following
Orelli says ε “ Orelli has very correctly
pointed to the reason why Cicero here does
not say ‘libri‚' which we think of as being
rather in people's hands, but ‘chartae,' dead
11011015, which at most are still preserved

word paints l ”

quum facere non possent] Not being
able to do such things as our men did
(Manutius). But, as he says ‘ mutatis
Graeciae temporibus,’ he seems to mean
that after the great age of Athens was
passed, the great age of acting, the Athe-
nians came to talking and writing only.

voluptatis caussa] He alludes to Aris-
tippus and the Cyrenaici, and more particu-
larly perhaps to Epicurus; but Aristippus
meant sensual 1110051110, and Epicurus tran-
quillity and peace of mind. Seneca (De
Beata Vita, 0. 13) says: ‘⁴ quam nos virtute
legem dicimus, eam ipse dicit voluptate3
jubet ille parere naturae3 parum autem est
luxuriae quod naturae satis est.'’ Cicero
says: ‘⁴ esse quendam Athenis qui se sapien-
tem profiteretur; eumque dicere omnia quae
faceremus ad voluptatem esse referenda'’
(Cic. De Sen. c. 13).

diquitatem] Ι suppose ‘dignitas' is
here the same as ‘virtus ς’ for Cicero says
elsewhere “voluptas maxime est inimica
virtuti.” Manutius refers to Calliphon's
opinions (Cic. De Fin. ii. 6): “Calliphon
adjunxit ad honestatem voluptatem.” Cicero
often mentions Calliphon and his doctrine;
and (De Off. iii. 3) he condemns Calliphon
and Dinomachus, ‘⁴ qui se dirempturos con-
troversiam putaverunt, si cum honestate
voluptatem tamquam cum homine pecudem
copulavissent.” If we had the philosopher’s
work, we might have a clearer notion what
he meant to say, what in fact he meant by
‘ voluptas.' Seneca as usual has some fine
talk on the enmity between pleasure and
virtue (De Beata Vita, c. 7).
