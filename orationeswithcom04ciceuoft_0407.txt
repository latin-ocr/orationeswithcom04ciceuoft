GAP. 1—-3, 385

omnes clarissimorum regum res gestas cum tuis nec contentionum
‚magnitudinQ nec numero praeliorum, nec varietate regionum, nec
celeritate conficiendi, nec dissimilitudine bellorum posse conferri3
nec vero disjunctissimas terras citius passibus cujusquam potuisse
peragrari quam tuis non dicam cursibus, sed victoriis lustratae
sunt. Quae quidem ego nisi ita magna esse fatear ut ea vix
cujusquam mens aut cogitatio capere possit, amens sim. Sed
tamen sunt alia majora. Nam bellicas laudes solent quidam> ex-
tenuare verbis easque detrahere ducibus, communicare cum multis,
ne propriae sint imperatorum; et certe in armis militum virtus,
locorum opportunitas, auxilia sociorum, classes, commeatus multum
juvant3 maximam vero partem quasi suo jure fort-una sibi vindicat,
et quidquid prospere gestum est, id paene omne ducit suum. At
vero hujus gloriae, O. Caesar,- quam es paullo ante adeptus, socium
habes neminem. Totum hoc, quantumcumque est, quod certe
maximum est, totum est, inquam, tuum. Nihil sibi ex ista laude
centurio, nihil praefectus, nil-‚il cohors', nihil turma deee1·pit; quin
etiam illa ipsa rerum humanarum domina Fortuna in istius se
societatem gloriae non offert, tibi cedit, tuam esse totam et pro-
priam fatetur; numquam enim temeritas 011111 sapientia com-
miscetur, neque ad consilium casus admittitur. ΙΙΙ. Domuisti

Caesar himself has some remarks ou For-
tuna (B. G. vi. 30, 35, 42).

Nihil sibi ex ista laude . . . decerpit]
Declamatory, says Wolf. He might have
said worse than that. Drumann¹s answer to
Wolf is this: “ Then we must conclude that
all the speeches are spurious in which Cicero
pictures with much more sounding words
the crimes of Verres, the horrible designs of
Catilina, and the outrageous acts and vices
of his private enemies.'’ There are plenty
of passages in Cicero such as Drumann
alludes to, but why did he not point out one
like this, in which the sound is not so strik-
ing as the silliness ?—Neither centurion, nor
commender of horse, neither cohort, nor
company of cavalry, plucks a leaf from the
victorious bay (decerpit), the crowning work
of Caesar, the pardon of Marcellus. Nay,
even dame Fortune gives up all claim to
share the honour of Caesar-'s magnanimity
—to a man whom he did not feam—llere is
a, passage on which those who maintain that
this speech is not the genuine work of

voL. lv-

Cicero, must take their stand. The lan-
guagc is faultless. The thought is ridicu-
lons.

se societatem] The right place of ‘se’
is doubtful. Baiter places it after ⁸ g101·iae,’
following G. E.

numquam enim . . . admittilur] We
understand his meaning, but it is a rheto-
rical style, neither precise nor'clear. ⁴ Bash-
ness aud prudence do not go together)
Fortune may sometimes favour rashness3
but prudence does not want her aid. 1 think
Caesar may be sometimes blamed sor rash-
ncss. The writer says again, ‘nor is
chance admitted to well-considered mea-
sures ;' which is pretty much the same
thing over again. Feebleucss appears in
repetition, the infallible sign of want of
thought.

3. Domuisli yenles] He begins again.
lle has not said enough3 and yet lic says
too much. But wc sce why this is said
again. It introduces ⁴ animum vincere,
iracundiam cohibere;' and the. transition
from the eonquests over men and matter to
tho conquest of the mind is effi-ormi by the
‘ nulla est . . . possit,' an idle dcelmnator's
phrase.
