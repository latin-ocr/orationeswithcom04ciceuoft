380 PRO M. MARCELLO.

manded a part of Pompeius’ fleet in B.c. 48 (B. C. iii. 5), but he is not
mentioned afterwards, Caius the cousin did not leave Italy during the
civil war, and Caesar pardoned him as well as Cicero.

XVhen Cicero was again settled at Rome, he wrote to Marcellus (Ad
Div. iv. 7, 8, 9) several letters, in which hc urged him to return and ask
for pardon, but Marcellus refused. Cicero tells how the affair was
managed in a letter which he addressed to Servius Sulpicius, then governor
of Achaea (13.0. 46). L. Piso, Caesar’s father-in-law, spoke of M. Mar*-
cellus’ case in the senate, C. Marcellus threw himself at Caesar’s feet,
and all the senate rose and approached Caesar 111 a suppliant manner.
Caesar, after blaming the peevish temper of Marcellus, and speaking
highly of Servius Sulpicius, who had been Marcellus’ colleague in the
consulship, all at once, and contrary to expectation, said that he could
not refuse the request of the senate, even though it was Marcellus for
whom he was solicited. Cicero adds that this day was so glorious that
he imagined that he saw something like the image of the republic re-
stored to life: ‘⁴ Itaque quum omnes ante me rogati gratias Caesari egis-
sent praeter Volcatium—is enim si eo loco esset negavit se facturum
fuisse—ego rogatus mutavi meum consilium. Nam statueram non me-
hercule inertia, sed desiderio pristinae dignitatis in perpetuum tacere.
Fregit hoc meum consilium et Caesaris magnitudo animi et senatus
officium. Itaque pluribus verbis egi Caesari gratias, meque metuo ne
etiam 111 ceteris rebus honesto otio privarim, quod erat unum solatium
in malis. Sed tamen quoniam effugi ejus offensionem, qui fortasse
arbitraretur me hanc rem publicam non putare, si perpetuo tacerem,
modice 1100 faciam aut etiam intra modum ut et illius voluntati et meis
studiis serviam ’' (to Sulpicius).

Marcellus wrote a short letter to Cicero (Ad Div. iv. 11) 111 reply to
a letter from C. Marcellus and from Cicero. Drumann describes it as
“short and heartless.’' It is certainly short3 but I think that it is a
dignified letter, and shows Marcellus to have been a man of firm cha·
racter. He was 111 110 hurry to come to Rome, and Cicero urged him
111 another letter (Ad Div. iv. 10), which seems to have been written in
110. 45.

Servius, the proconsul of Achaea, returning on the 23rd of May from
Epidaurus to the Piraeus, found Marcellus there on his way to Rome,
and he spent the day with Marcellus. On the day but one after this
day, Servius, who was going into Boeotia to hold his courtS, received
information early in the morning that Marcellus had been assassinated
111 the Piraeus by his friend and companion P. lNIagius Cilo, that Magius
had killed himself, and that there was some hope of Marcellus recover-
ing. Servius set out to the Piraeus, but he found Marcellus dead. The
body was burnt in the Academia, and the Proconsul ordered the Athe-
