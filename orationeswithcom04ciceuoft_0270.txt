248 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

magis honeste quam vere sodalitas nominaretur, quam quisque
tribum turpi largitione corrumperet, eum maxime iis hominibus qui
ejus tribus essent esse notum. Ita putavit senatus, quum reo
tribus ederentur eae quas is largitione devinctas haberet, eosdem
fore testes et judices. Acerbum omnino genus judicii, sed tamen,
si vel sua vel ea quae maxime esset cuique conjuncta tribus ede-
retur, vix recusandum. XVI. Tu autem, Laterensis, quas tribus
edidisti? Terentinam, credo. Fuit certe id aequum, et certe exss
spectatum est, et fuit dignum constantia tua. Cujus tu tribus
venditorem et corruptorem et sequestrem Plancium fuisse clamitas,
eam tribum profecto severissimorum praesertim hominum et gra-
vissimorum edere debuisti. At Voltiniam : libet etenim tibi nescio
quid etiam de illa tribu criminari. Hanc igit-ur ipsam cur non edi-
disti? Quid Plancio cum Lemonia? quid cum Ufentina? quid cum
Crustumina? Nam Maeciam, non quae judicaret, sed quae reji-
ceretur, esse voluisti. Dubitatis igitur, judices, quin vos M. Late-
rensis suo judicio non ad sententiam legis, sed ad suam spem ali-

Romans had a similar inaccurate expression for where there is a trial by jury there are

when they said that a man was guilty or
convicted of Repetundae.

16. Terentinam] ‘Teretinam' T. E.
as usual, and Baiter. But the tribe was
called Terentina, from Terentum, as the
learned say, Terentum being a place outside
the walls in the Campus Martius, near the
Tiber. The Atinates were included in the
Terentina (Garatoni).

venditorem . . . sequestrem] See c. 22.
Laterensis had not named the Terentina
among the ‘ tribus’ from which the jury was
to be selected. Cicero says that he ought
to have named it because this ‘ tribus' con-
tained a great number of honourable men;
and Wunder adds that the Judices from
this ⁴ tribus’ would of all others have had
the best evidence, if they knew that their
‘ tribules' had been corrupted. But if any
of the bribed were among the J udices, they
might have acquitted Plancius, though they
knew that he was guilty3 and if any who
were not bribed were among the Judices,
how were they to know that others had
been bribed? If they did not know it,
they could not convict Plancius, except
they convicted him because they thought
that he had bribed, and in that case they
would have convicted without evidence. If
they did know it, that knowledge was not
evidence against Plancius, unless they had
produced that evidence before the court
like other witnesses3 and if they had been
made witnesses, they could not be jurymen,

two parties to the evidence, one party who
gives the evidence, and another party, the
jury, whose business it is to set a proper
value on the evidence. One man cannot
perform the double part of giving evidence
and forming an opinion upon it.

Ufentina] ‘ Oufentina,' Baiter. ⁴ Ueien—
tina’ is the common reading. Wunder says
that the best MSS. have ‘ Ufentina.' It is

said that the old inscriptions have ‘Ou- ,

fentina.' — ‘ Crustumina ε’ ‘ Clustumina ’
T. E„ Baiter. See Pro Balbo, c. ⁶25. There
may have been this variety in writing the
name. “Hujus tribus X1v inscriptiones
vidi, in quibus semel tantum σιω, semper
vero vel eLU vel eLusr exaratum erat''
(Onufr. Panvinio de Civ. Rom„ quoted by
Wunder).

Maeciam] Laterensis had selected the
Lemonia,Ufentina‚ and Crustumina. Cicero
asks, What had Plancius to do with them?
Perhaps he means that Plancius was not
charged with bribing them. If so, what
tribes could more fairly be selected? La—
terensis added a fourth, the Maecia, which
he knew that Plancius would reject for
some reason, but for what reason we do
not knOW. Garatoni suggests that it. was
hostile to Plancius, and perhaps Laterensis
belonged to it. And perhaps he did not.
Who knows ?

suojudicio] Laterensis chose the ‘ tribus'
as he pleased, and he had power to do it,
or Cicero would have told us that the jury
