258 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO
functi honoribus, sed apertius quam vel ambitionis vel aetatis tuae
ratio postulabat. Quamobrem in dissentiente populo noli putare
nullos fuisse, quorum animos tuus ille fortis animus offenderet, qui
te incautum fortasse nunc tuo loco demovere potuerunt, providen-
tem autem et praecaventem numquam certe movebunt.

An te illa argumenta duxerunt? Dubitabitis, inquit, quin coitio
facta sit, quum tribus plerasque cum Plotio tulerit Plancius 3-An
una fieri potuerunt, si una tribus non tulissent 3—-At nonnullas
punctis paene totidem.—Quippe, quum jam facti prope superioribus
comitiis declaratique venissent3 quamquam ne id quidem suspicio-
nem coitionis habuerit 3 neque enim umquam majores nostri sorti-
tionem constituissent aediliciam, nisi viderent accidere posse ut
competitores pares suffragiis essent. Et ais prioribus comitiis
Aniensem a Plotio Pedio, Terentinam a Plancio tibi esse conces-

illa aryumenta] What he is going to
mention, ‘ Dubitabitis . . . Plancius ? ' To
this question Cicero replies ⁴ An . . . tulis-
sent?’ ‘could they have been elected to-
gether, if they had not together got the
votes of the tribes?’ Laterensis still in-
sists, ‘ At . . . totidem :⁹ ⁴ But they got some
tribes by nearly the same number of votes :⁷
“Puncta enim hic non aliter quam in de-
fensione Murenae suffragia significant’'
(Schol. Vat.).—‘ quippe ε’ ⁶ to be sure‚’ says
Cicero, ‘ this was a matter of course, since
they had been almost elected and returned
at the former comitia? though, he adds,
there was then no suspicion of a coalition,
and mere equality of votes proves nothing,
because it had been foreseeu that candidates
might have an equal number of votes, and
it was provided that the electiou should
then be determines] by lot.

Wunder has a long note on this passage3
much longer than is necessary. The pas-
sage is plain if we distinguish what Cicero
says froin what Laterensis is supposed to
say. The suspicion of ‘coitio‚' t'or there
was no proof, nor does it appear that
‘ coitio’ itself was illegal, was derived
from the fact that the majority of Plancius
and of Plotius was made by nearly the
same tribes. Wunder supposes a case in
which each might have a majority of the
tribes, and yet each should have only a few
tribes the same as the other. lt requires
no great sagacity to see that out of thirty-
five votes Plancius might have nineteen,
and Plotius sixteen3 and if Plotius had two
votes more out of the nineteen, he would
have eighteen in all; and yet Plancius and
Plotius would then have only two votes in

common. Wunder remarks this to show
that Cicero’s ‘ An una . . . tulissent’ is no
answer. But if each of the successful can-
didates got a much larger· part of the
thirty-five votes than nineteen, what then?
Cicero's answer would be complete. Nor,
if the state of the poll had been what
Wunder supposes, would that have fur-
nished a presumption against a coalition,
for it might have been agreed that Plotius
should direct all his canvass to one half of
the tribes, and Plancius to the other half,
and so oue might be safe with a little help
from the other. But there is no eud of
argumentation on such a matter.

Aniensem] The ‘tribus' of Plotius, as
the Terentina was the ‘ tribus' of Plancius,
which we might conclude, if Cicero had
said nothing else3 but he adds ‘ jacturam
suarum tribuum.'—‘ ne in angustum ve-
nirent :' at the second electiori Laterensis
says, Plotius did not help Pedius, nor did
Plancius help Laterensis, each with his
own ‘ tribus,' for they feared that they might
want the vote of these ‘ tribus ⁷ themselves.
Cicero argues that there is no consistency
(convenit) in this assertion, that Pedius
and Plancius were willing to do this before
the first election, when the result was un-.
certain, and should refuse to do the same
again when the result was known, and they
saw that they were secure for the next
election.—‘angustias:’ “ipsius Laterensis
haec verba fuisse, quibus significaverit, ne
suffragiis necessariis privarentur, ex sequen-
tibus intelligitur, in quibus Cicero ridicu-
lum hoc loquendi genus reddit '’ (Wun-
der).
