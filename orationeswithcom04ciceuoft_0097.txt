CAP. 25, 26. 75
facta erat balneatori. Atque equidem vehementer exspecta-
bam, quinam isti viri boni testes hujus manifesto deprehensi

veneni dicerentur; nulli enim sunt adhuc nominati. Sed non

· dubito quin sint pergraves, qui primum sint talis feminae familiares,

deinde eam provinciam susceperint ut in balneas contruderentur3
quod illa nisi a viris honestissimis ac plenissimis dignitatis, quam
velit sit potens, numquam impetravisset. Sed quid ego de digni-
tate istorum testium loquor? Virtutem eorum diligentiamque '
cognoscite. In balneis delituerunt: testes egregios! dein temere
prosiluerunt. Homines gravitati deditos! Sic enim fingunt, quum
Licinius venisset, pyxidem teneret in manu, conaretur tradere,
nondum tradidisset, tum repente evolasse istos praeclaros testes
sine nomine; Licinium autem, quum jam manum ad tradendam
pyxidem porrexisset, retraxisse atque illo repentino hominum

impetu se in fugam conjecisse.

Horace, Sati. 3, v. 137, and Macleane’s note.
—-‘ quadrantaria’ agrees with ‘permuta-
tione,’ and Cicero seems to allude to some
story about her, possibly the story which
Plutarch tells. Still the words ⁴ quadran-
taria illa permutatione ’ mean no more than
⁴ by that (usual) exchange of the quadrans ’
sor the bath. A woman of Clodia’s rank
and wealth ought not to have gone to the
public bath; and Cicero means to say that
she did go there, and we must infer, for the
purpose of seeing her lovers. Some of the
explanations of the passage are most absurd.
Klotz has a wonderful note on it, a most
curious mixture of sense and nonsense.
Orelli says ‘¹ recte Garatoni,’‘ and Garatoni
says : ‘⁴ Ciceronem ipsum arbitror, contume-
liae quasi capite indicato, aliorum dicacitati
reliqua permittere voluisse.”

Quintilian (viii. 6, 53) gives this word
and others as an example of ‘aenigma'
He says “ut Caelius quadrantariam (115-
temnestram, et in triclinio Coam, in cubi-
culo Nolam.” She was a Clytemnestra,
because she was said to have killed her hus-
band Metellus; a quadrantaria, as some ex-
plain it, because she was like a common
prostitute who sold herself cheap. The ex-
planation of ⁴ Coam ' and ‘ Nolam ¹ is diffi-
cult; and not worth the trouble. But it
has been done by ‘⁴ Fr. C. Forbergius, peri-
tissimus harum reruni arbiter atque existi-
mator, in Antonii Panormitae Hermaphro-
dito, p. 283'’ (Meyer, Orat. Rom. Frag.
ed. 2 .

viri boni] Such ‘honest gentlemen'
used to lie in wait to detect knaves, like

O magna vis veritatis quae contra

policemen in our time. Cicero speaks of
them Pro Cluentio, c. 16. The witnesses
were not yet examined, but the prosecutor-s
might have mentioned their names, if they
chose.—‘ eam provinciam? ‘ such a busi-
nes5‚’ one of the familiar meanings of ⁴ pro-
vincia' (Verr. ii. 4, c. 23, Vol. i.).

nisi a viris] Manutius proposes to omit
‘nisi.’ He says “negatur enim Clodiam
id impetrare potuisse, quamquam potens
admodum esset, a viris honestissimis: ad
ne andum autem sufficit numquam.- si ad-
daim, nisi, ex negatione fiet affirmatio.'’
Garatoni observes that every body will be
surprised that Manutius did not see the
irony. Not every body; for those who
have read Manutius’ notes with care will
know that he was incapablc ofunderstanding
a joke.

yravitati deditos] E. G. S. ⁴ temperantes'
P. Halm. Lambinus says that *omnes
libri vctcrcs' have ‘ temperantes? but his
assertion is not true. lle proposed ⁴ intem-
perantes,’ but ⁴ tcmpcrantes’ is ironicul.
They were so impatient to scize the inan
that they sprung out too soon (temere). It
is difficult to conjecture. how the variution
in the reading originutcd.

mayna vis . . qnae . . defendat] Grent
is the power of trulh, and great enough to
defend itself unnided. Muretus compares n
passage in Aeschines, In Timarch. p. 107.
about truth being strong enough to premit
over ull human device& But. us Orelli re-
marks, this is ono of that kind ot* snyings
which may come into any man's head in the
proper place.
