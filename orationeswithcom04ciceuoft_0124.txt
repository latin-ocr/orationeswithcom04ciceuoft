drawing up of the SCtum. were prefixed to
it. A letter of Cicero (Ad Fam. viii. 8)
contains a sample of the form of a SCtum
(⁴ scribendo adfuerunt L. Domitius Cn. Filius
Ahenobarbus &c.'). See Cicero, De Or.

praeda ante parta] He did not get much
so far as we see in 13.c. 58 in the Helvetic
war and in the war with Ariovistus. In B.c.
57 he had sold fifty—three thousand prisoners
taken at the capture of the town of the Adua-
tuci (B. G. ii. 29). What he had got was
however to be kept for the triumph says
Cicero, on which occasion large sums of
money were often brought into the treasury.
The splendour of the triumph was increased
by the display of the precious metals got in
a campaign. Caesar made a great show at
his triumph, which he did not celebrate till
many years after this date (Appian, B. C. ii.
101). His soldiers received out of the trea-
sure displayed at the triumph what Caesar
had promised them, and even more.

Caesar never says any thing in his Com-
mentaries about the money that he received
from Rome, nor of his ten legati. It is dif-
ficult to make out the number of his legati
from his own Commentaries. He mentions
nine in 13.c. 52 (B. G. vi. 90), at atime
when he had ten legions; and accordingly
Manutius concludes that he had ten legati.
But we do not conclude that a general had
ten legati, when he mentions nine only.
Caesar may have had ten legati, but we
cannot infer that he had that number, be-
cause he had ten legions. In B.c. 541oe
also mentions nine legati (B. G. v. 24).
Hotmann says ‘⁴ Caesar had ten legions in
Gallia, each commanded by 3 legatus, as we
learn from Caesar's commentaries.⁷' But he
had not ten at first. In B.c. 58 he had
only six. Not one of the commentators of
Cicero that I have fallen on had ever read
Caesar’s commentaries carefully. Dion Cas-

sius, after speaking of the first two cam—
paigns of Caesar, says (39, c. 25) that the
populus admired Caesar’s exploits so much
that they sent to him senators, as if the
Galatae were completely subdued, and were
elated to such hopes of what he could do
that they voted him a large sum of money.
This greatly annoyed Pompeius, who at-
tempted to persuade the consuls not to read
Caesar’s letters immediately, but to conceal
them as long as possible, until the report of
them should prevail, and to appoint a suc-

cessor to Caesar before the proper time. ,

These senators of Dion seem to be the
‘ decem legati' mentioned by Cicero. It
was usual after the conquest of a country
for the senate to send ten legati, by and
with whose advice the general who com-
manded regulated the affairs of the country,
and settled the form of its administration.

If Cicero means ten legati, ten men to act
under Caesar, ten generals in fact, the words
‘exempla quaerebant’ may be intelligible.
If he means ten legati to assist in the settle-
ment of the conquered country, there was
no want of precedent in that, for it was the
usual thing. But the words ⁴ quos alii non
dabant,' and the whole matter, show I think
that he means the legati to serve under
Caesar.

12. in superioribus] Lambinus added
‘ in‚' which is not in C.-—‘ affecta :’ see c. 8.
——‘ credo :’ ironically as usual. The centre
and north of Gallia was yet little known to
the Romans, and being cold in winter and
a great part of it umultivated, the country
was not very pleasant. Abi-ami acutely
conjectures that the want of ‘amoenitas '
was rather owing to deficient culture than
the poorness of the soil. He is quite right.
France contains a very large proportion of
good land. He quotes from Varro (De R. R.
i. 7) Scrofa’s description of Gallia near
the Rhine, which is not very attractive.
