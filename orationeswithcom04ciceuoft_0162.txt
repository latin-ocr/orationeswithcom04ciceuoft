140 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

levarunt, se 1100 jus 0550 velle, ut sibi et liberis, si qui eximia virtute
fuerit, sit in nostris castris, sit in irnperatmmm praetoriis, sit
denique intel sirrna atque in acie locus, sit his gradibus ascensus
etiam ad civitatem. XVIII. Quod si Afris, si Sardis, si Hispanis,
agris stipendioque mulctatis, virtute adipisci licet civitatem, Gadi-
tanis autem, officiis, vetustate, fide, periculis, foedere conjunctis, hoc
idem non licebit, non foedus sibi nobiscum, sed iniquissimas leges
impositas a nobis esse arbitrabuntur. Atque hanc„ judices, non a
me fingi orationem, sed me dicere quae Gaditani judicarint res ipsa
declarat. Hospitium multis annis ante hoc tempus cum L. Cornelio
Gaditanos fecisse publice dico. Proferam testeS, ἕξ eram legatos;
excito laudatores3 ad hoc judicium⁷ summos homines ac nobilis-
simos, deprecatores hujus periculi, missos videtis. Re denique
multo ante Gadibus inaudita, fore huic ut ab illo periculum crea-
retur, * * gravissima autem in istum civem suum Gaditani senatus-
consulta fecerunt. Potuit magis fundus populus Gaditanus fieri,
quoniam hoc magno opere delectare verbo, si tum fit fundus quum
scita ac jussa nostra sua sententia comprobat, quam quum hospitium
fecit, ut et civitate illum mutatum esse fateretur et hujus civitatis
honore dignissimum judicaret? Potuit certius interponere judicium

plied the Romans with corn ‘at this time,'

at the time when they were supplying Pom-

peius in the war with Sertorium and they
had supplied the wants of Rome before.
Gades is an island separated from the main-
land by a narrow channel. It must have
been supplied with corn from the fertile
plains of Andalusia, and we may perhaps
assume that the Gaditani had public grana-
ries in which they kept stores. These and
other facts show that it was a large city
with an extensive commerce.

18. Afris] The inhabitants of the Roman
Provincia Africa formed in 13.c. 146. Part
of their lands were made Roman, the pro-
perty of the State, and the people paid Sti-
pendium. (De Lege Agraria, ii. 22, Vol.
ii.) Sardinia with Corsica was another
Roman province, which was formed in B.c.
231. Sardinia was a conquered country,
and it was treated with severity. The land
was made Publicus, paid a tenth of the pro-
duce, and also ‘ stipendium’ or a money pay-
ment. (Livy, 23, 0. 32, 41.) Both Hispa-
niae contained many stipendiariae civitates.

testes] ¹ testesseram (testeseram ΡΙ.)
legatos excito laudatores ad ' C. Baiter fol-
lowing Madvig writes, ⁴ proferam tesseram 3
legatos excit03 laudatores ad hoc judicium

. . missos videtis) The word ‘ teste-
seram’ is intended either for ‘tesseram,'

the first three letters being repeated ;
or it is intended for ‘testes ’ followed by

‘proferam’ or some other word ending in

‘eram.' If ‘tesseram ’ is the reading, we
must understand that Cicero offers to pro-
duce the ‘tessera hospitalis' as evidence
of what the Gaditani had done for Balbus.
The best evidence that Cicero could pro-
duce would be the witnesses, whom he men-
tions afterwards. If we compare the words
at the end of the chapter, they correspond
with what we have here. ‘Cives . . . lega-
vit, testes hujus juris, vitae laudatores, peri-
culi deprecatores ς’ where we have ⁸ legati,
testes, laudatores, deprecatores,' which is
exactly the enumeration mentioned here,
except that the order is not quite the same.
I think it is likely that the ‘ eram ’ at the
end of ‘testeseram’ may mean nothing at ’
all ; and that the passage should stand thus :
‘ Proferam testes legatos ; excito laudatores3
ad hoc judicium,’ διο.

Re . . . inaudita] ‘When it was whis-
pered long before at Gades, that some
trouble was going to be caused to Balbus by
the prosecutor.’ After the word ‘ crearetur ’
something about Balbus seems to have been
omitted, as Halm discovered. In place of
⁴ gravissima autem ’ some editions have
⁴ gravissima tum!
