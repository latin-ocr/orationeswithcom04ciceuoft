392 ORAT. PRO M. MARCELLO

multa perderet et ornamenta dignitatis et praesidia stabilitatis
suae, multaque uterque dux faceret armatus, quae idem togatus
fieri 1>›1·‹›hil›uisset. Quae quidem tibi nunc omnia belli vulnera
curanda suut, quibus praeter te mederi nemo potest. Itaque illam
tuam praeclarissimam et sapientissimam vocem invitus audivi,
Satis diu vel naturae vixi vel gloi·iae.——Satis, si ita vis, fort-asse
naturae, addo etiam, si placet, gloriae: at, quod maximum est,
patriae certe parum. Quare omitte istam, quaeso, doctorum ,
hominum in contemnenda morte prudentiam: noli nostro periculo
esse sapiens. Saepe enim venit ad aures meas te idem istud nimis
crebro dicere, tibi satis te vixisse. Credo, sed tuni id audirem, si
tibi soli viveres, aut si tibi etiam soli natus esses. Omnium
salutem civium cunctamque rem *publicam res tuae gestae com-
plexae sunt: tantum abes a perfectione maximorum operum, ut
fundamenta quae cogitas nondum jeceris. Hic, tu modum vitae
tuae non salute rei publicae, sed aequitate animi definies? Quid,
si istud ne gloriae tuae quidem satis est? cujus te esse avidis-
simum quamvis sis sapiens non negabis. Parumne igitur, inquies,
ι

naturae] Caesar had attained his fifty-

and he who is brave in battle may not be
fourth year, as Abrami reminds us3 and so

brave on all occasions. Men become care-

Caesar is supposed to have said that he had
attained an age which might be considered
as a natural limit of existence. It was a
‘praeclarissima et sapientissima vox,' but
he heard it ‘ unwillingly,' and for the reason
which he gives. He had heard it once at
least; and perhaps Caesar may have said it
in the senate on this occasion. Then he tells
us that it. had often reached his ears : ‘ Saepe
enim venit‚' &a This looks like a useless
repetition, but if Caesar, as I have suggested,
had just said it in the senate, the orator
may properly add that he had heard that he
was in the babit of saying it.

doctorum hominum] Philosophers, whose
‘ prudentia' is their philosophy, which
teaches them not to sear death, as Socrates,
and the Stoics, Antoninus, for instance, at
a later time.

contemnenda morte] ‘ Contemnere ’
means to value slightly, to put a small
estimation on a thing, and so it may be
applied either to a thing considered valu-
able, which we do not desire, or to a thing
considered formidable, which we do not
fear. Caesar said “that it was better to die
at once than to be always expecting death'’
(Plutarch, Caesar, c. 57). For many years
he had exposed his life iu the field, and a
man with even less natural courage than he
possessed must have become careless about
danger. There are many kinds of courage,

less about danger when it presents itself
daily. A habit of indifference is the effect
of familiarity. But contempt of death after
a man has attained to supreme power must
be the result of reflection.

tum id audirem] ‘then I would listen
to it,’ ‘I would assent? a way of express-
ing assent. ‘Audio’ is used thus by the
comic writers and by Cicero.

sed tum . . . natus esses] Quoted by the
Schol. on Lucan, v. (1863 but the Schol.
has “aut etiam si tibi soli natus esses''
(Baiter). The lines are:

“ Quo te, dure, tulit virtus temeraria, Cae-

sar?
21< a< u *

Quum tot in hac anima populorum vita
salusque

Pendgazigtntantus caput hoc sibi fecerit

The Schol. has a note on ‘pendeatz' he
sayS, “Ut Cicero, ex unius tua vita pendere

omnia.'’ See c. 7. On the line of Lucan

(ii. 383),

“Nec sibi, sed toti genitum se credere
mund0,”

which is applied to Cato, the Schol. has
the remark, “Ut Cicero, Si tibi soli natus
esseS, viveres tibi,” an example which shows
that we cannot always trust to scholiasts
for literal quotation.
