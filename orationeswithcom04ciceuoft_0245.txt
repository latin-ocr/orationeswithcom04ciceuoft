INTRODUGTION. 223

to give his vote to any candidate, and it is also admitted that when the
voting is open he may through intimidation, or out of regard to his
interest, give it to one man while he would prefer giving it to another.
Wunder concludes that the Lex Licinia contained also a prohibition
against the ‘ coitio ' of candidates. He rightly explains ‘ coitio' of can-
didates to mean a combination of one candidate with another for the
purpose of preventing a third candidate from being elected, an instance
of which we find in the consular election of Cicero, against whom C.
Antonius, who was elected, and Catilina who lost his eleetion, formed a
combination, which led Cicero to make an invective against both of
them a few days before the comitia were held (Asconon. In toga Can-
dida, p. 83, ed. Orelli). But Wunder draws his conclusion from two
assumptions3 first, that ‘coitio' was a kind of ‘vis,’ the object of
which was to defeat a candidate’s election3 and, second, that the pur-
pose of the Lex Licinia was to punish those who employed ‘ vis ’ in their
elections. But I do not admit that either of these assumptions is true.
In the trials under the Lex Licinia the J udices were called ‘ edititii '
or ‘ editicii 3’ and such J udices are mentioned in the speech Pro Murena
(c, 23). It is only from this oration that we ean determine who the
Judices editicii were, and the commentators do not agree about the
matter. Cicero speaks of them ‘oratorie,’ that is, he uses general ex-
pressions which may mislead us (e. 17); but there are passages (cc.
15, 16) which seem to show how they were selected. First, it is plain
that the prosecutor named certain ‘tribus,’ out of which the J udices
must be selected3 and again Cicero speaks of the defendant being de-
prived of the power of challenge (rejectio), which was allowed in ordi-
nary trials for Ambitus. It seems that the prosecutor named four
tribus, that the defendant might reject one, and that the J udices were
taken from the other three in some way (cc. 15, 163 Cicero, Ad Ati-¹.
iv. 15), and that he had no power to challenge these J udices. Wunder
(Prolegom. p. lxxvii) defines the ‘judices editicii ' to be those who are
determined (constituti) by the prosecutor, and none of whom ean be
challenged by the defendant3 he defines the ‘editi' to be those who
are selected (delecti) by the prosecutor, and whom the defendant ean
challenge. He adds in a note that Ferratius is wonderfully in error
who sayS, “ Ut enim Liciniae legis dc sodaliciis acerbitatem amplificet
per quam aecusator tribus edebat, ex quibus praetor judiees sortiretur 111
reum.'' Some eommentators suppose that these tribus were the ordi-
nary tribus, Which is the better opinion, for Cicero speaks of the tribes

by name. Others suppose that they are the. tribus of the Judiccs 111
the Album Judi0um3 but Ι see no reason for this opinion.

The penalty under the Lex Licinia was exsilium (Pro Plancio, c· 23) ;
