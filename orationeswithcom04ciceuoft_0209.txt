Quum eqo] ‘ Cum ego eum‚' Halm, but
C. omits ‘eum.' Faernus established the
right reading of this passage as far as ‘ laces-
sivit,' by giving the ‘antiqua lectio’ in
place of the ‘ vulgata.' The ⁴ vulgata’ con-
tained ‘responsione’ in place of ‘ sponsione!
Cicero had said that the man entered Rome
by the Caelimontana, Piso challenged him
in the Sponsio‚ which began with the formal
word ‘ Ni:' ‘⁴ If he had not entered by the
Esquiline gate,’' he would be content to
lose the amount named in the sponsio. As
to the natare of the Sponsio, and the
formula Ni, see Vol. ii. Index, Sponsio3
and Vol. i. Index, Ni.

triumphali] ‘A triumphal gate;’ that
being a triumphal gate under which a tri-
umphant general entered the city (Becker,
Handbuch, διο. vol. i. p. 152); an expla-
nation which savcs the trouble of looking
for the site of the Porta Triumphalis. The
other passages in which a Porta Trium-
phalis is mentioned, arc Tacitus, Ann.
i. ὃς Suetonius, Aug. 1003 and Dion Cas-
sius, 56, c. 42. Becker contenda that the
passage in Josephus (Bell. dud. vii. 5)
shows that the triumphat gate through
which passed Vespasian's and Titus' tri-
umph was a triumphal arch in the Campus

“ Martius.

In this passage the meaning is plain
without assuming that there was a gale
named Triumphalis. “What matters it
by what gate you entered, if it was not a
triumphal gate ?'' But Cicero adds ‘quae
porta‚' repeating the word ‘porta' em-
phatically, and this form of expression
seemsincorreet, if he means that any gale
might be a triumphal gate. If there was
no Porta called Triumphalis, Cicero must
mean to say that there was some gnte,
whatever it was, through which all trium-
phant generals passed. The common ex-
planation is, that there was such a gare,
and that it was between the Flumentnnn
and Carmentalis, and was opened only t'nr
those who triumphed. Becker's arguments
may be examined by those who are carious
about the matter.
