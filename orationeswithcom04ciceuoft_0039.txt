OAP. 8, 9. 17

collegae tui mitti juberent, fecerisne ante rostra pontem continuatis
tribunalibus, per quem consul populi Romani moderatissimus et
constantissimus, sublato auxilio, exclusis amicis, vi perditorum
hominum incitata, turpissimo miserrimoque spectaculo, non in
carcerem, sed ad supplicium et ad necem duceretur? Quaero, ,
1111111 quis ante te tam fuerit nefarius qui id fecerit? ut sciamus,
utrum veterum facinorum sis imitator an inventor novorum. Idem-
que tu quum his atque hujusmodi consiliis ac facinoribus, nomine
O. Caesaris clementissimi atque optimi viri, scelere vero atque
audacia tua, M. Bibulum foro, curia, templis, locis publicis omnibus
expulisses, inclusum domi contineres, quumque non majestate im-
perii, non jure legum, sed januae praesidio et parietum custodiis
consulis vita tegeretur, miserisne viatorem qui M. Bibulum domo vi
extraheret, ut, quod in privatis semper est servatum, id te tribuno
pl. consuli domus exsilium esse non posset? Simulque mihi
respondeto tu, qui nos, qui de communi salute consentimus,

not give him their protection (auxilium),
nor his friends get to him. He was to be
taken to prison, but he might have been
killed ou the way, as Cicero insinuates, for
nobody could come to his assistance.

idsecerit] ‘Id secerit' means all that
Cicero has said, for this was not the first
instance of a consul having been ordered to
prison (Cic. De Legg. iii. 9). However,
Halm observes, the consul did not reach the
prison, for he was rescued by his friends
and taken ,to Jupiter Stator's temple, as
Appian says (B. C. ii. ll). Cicero leaves us
to infer that he was taken to prison.

eoepulisses] But Suetonius (Caesar, c. 20)
says that Caesar did this: “Lege agraria
promulgata obnuntiantem collegam armis
foro expulit.” See Dion 38, c. 6.—‘non
majestate imperii ε’ Hermann asks whether
Bibulus’ imperium or that of the Roman
people, for ⁴ majestas ' is properly the ⁴ am-
plitudo et dignitas civitatis‚' and he refers
to Cicero. De Or. ii. 39, and Pro C. Rabirio,
c. 1 and 3. It was a common expression.
Horace has it (Carm. iv. 15. 14) ε

“ famaque et imperi
Por-recta majestas ad ortum
Solis ab Hesperio cubili.'’

Hermann adds that ‘ majestas' is also said
of a consul’s and praetor’s power; and it
seems to be so hera—¹ jure legumz' see
De Donni, c. 15, and the note on this cx-
pression.—‘ viatorem :¹ an officer who suin-
moned a person to appear. It was a prin-
ciple of law that a man could not be sorcibly

a better authority is Paulus, Dig. 2. 4. 21,
quoted by Abi-ami).

id te tribuno pL]
Madvig among them, would omit the ⁴id,'
because the clause beginning with ⁴ id ' does
not correspond to the clause beginning with
‘quod.' Madvig says if ·id' is used, we
want another predicate, and that ⁸ domus '
cannot in any way be joined by ‘⁸ apposition
to that word by which the whole antient
rule of law is expressed, that is ‘ exsilium.y ”
If the pronoun is omitted, he observes. the
expressionis brief and rather han-sb, but not:
inconsistent with Cicero's usage. t'or the full

critics think that :ill may he right. If it is
right, the meaning isthat ‘what has always
been observed in the (111-1· os private persons
(that their house should be a place of re-
fuge), this in your tribunate was not allowed
to a consul, that his house should be his
protection.’
