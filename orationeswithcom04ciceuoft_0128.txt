ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

sine aliquo divino numine; nam si ille aditus Gallorum immanitati
multitudinique patuisset, numquam haec urbs summo imperio

domicilium ac sedem praebuisset.

Quae jam licet considant, nihil

est enim ultra illam altitudinem montium usque ad Oceanum quod

sit Italiae pertimescendum.

Sed tamen una atque altera aestas vel

metu vel spc vel poena vel praemiis vel armis vel legibus potest

totam Galliam sempiternis vinculis astringere.

Impolitae vero res

et acerbae si erunt relictae, quamquam sunt accisae, tamen efferent

se aliquando et ad renovandum bellum revirescent.

numerous states, govemed by nobles and
priests, and subject to continual revolutions.
The danger to Rome from the Gallie people
was over when North Italy was conquered,
and the south of France was secured. But
the nation was still uneasy. The whole
population of the Helvetii (13.c. 58) at-
tempted to break out of their prison be-
tween the Jura, the Alps, and the Rhine,
and to escape from the German pressure on
the east. The Germans had got into Bel-
gium as soon as the Romans were well set-
tled in the south of France, had seized the
fertile country on the Rhine north and south
of Strassburg‚ and had quartered themselves
also in Gallia west of the Rhine, between
the Jura and the Saone. Caesar by his
Helvetic and German campaigns of 13.c. 58
had freed the Province from all danger on
this side, and by his great victory over the
Belgians in B.c. 57 he had made the Roman
name a terror to the northern nations on
both sides of the Rhine (Caesar, B. G. ii.
35). An excellent modern writer has some
remarks on the configuration of the Euro-
pean peninsula, and its effects on the civili-
zation of Europe (Mignet, Introduction de
l'ancienne Germanie dans la Societe Civi-
lisee, Mem. Hist. p. l δια).

Quae jam licet considant] ‘The Alps
may now sink down’ to the level of the
plains: a bold way of speaking. ‘⁶ This
rhetorical turn is bold, and may be called
almost kokett '’ (Klotz). Bold it certainly
is; whether it is kokett 1 cannot tell, not
knowing what sense a German gives to a
French word which he does not understand.

⁴ Considere¹ signifies to ‘settle down.'
Cicero speaks in the same style again (In
Pis. c. 33). So Ovid says (Met. i. 43) in
his beautiful introduction, using another
form of the root sid .-

“ J ussit et extendi campos, subsidere valles,
Fronde tegi silvas, lapidosos surgere mon-
tes!

Quare sit in ,

sempiternis vinculis] It took rather
longer than Cicero expected to do this. In
B.c. 52 all the Gallie nations rose against
Caesar under Vercingetorix3 and nothing but
the genius of the great Roman general and
his unwearied activity put down this for-
midable enemy. But with the capture of
the hill fort of Alesia B.c. 52 the war was
ended, and Gallia received the chains in
which the Roman held her bound till the
German Franks again got the superiority.
In B.c. 50 the Gaul after being well beaten
was coaxed into submission by Caesar, who
was now meditating the conquest of Italy3
for the conquest of Gallia was the way to
eonquer Rome. Caesar's continuator has
well enough described his policy: ‘⁴ Caesar
in Belgio quum hiemaret, unum illud pro-
positum habebat continere iu amicitia civi-
tates, nuIli spem aut caussam dare armorum3
nihil enim minus volebat quam sub deces-
sum suum necessitatem sibi aliquam inponi
belli gerendi, ne quum exercitum deducturus
esset bellum aliquod relinqueretur, quod
omnis Gallia libenter sine praesenti periculo
susciperet. Itaque honorifice civitates ap-
pellando, principes maximis praemiis affici-
endo, nulla onera nova imponendo, defessam
tot adversis proeliis Galliam conditione
parendi meliore facile in pace continuit ''
(B. G. viii. 49).

acerbae] The metaphor has disturbed
the critics Nipperdey proposes ‘asperae,'
Baiter proposes ‘ crudae.’ Ι propose to let
Cicero speak in his own way. The things
will be ‘ impolitae‚' unfinished, left in the
rough (rudes); then he says ‘acerbae,'
sour‚ unripe3 then he says ‘accisae,'
lopped, pruned‚ clipped, cut short, like a
tree or a bird's wingS, as Horace has it (Sat.
ii. 2, v. ll4):

‘⁶ Integris opibus novi non latius usum
Quam nunc accisis.’'

Horace also has ‘⁴ decisis humilem pennis,”
speaking of himself.
