CAP. 14.

711

tribuantur, quae militibus ipsis tribui oporteret, si illi vixissent qui

morte vicerunt.

b i. If ‘iisque frat-ribus! is right, we may
accept Graevius’ opinion, that he means
that the brothers should have the military
promotion (promotiones militares) which
the dead had merited by their services.
Ursini says that an old MS. has ‘eaque
tribuantur,⁷ and he adds ‘ et ita legendum
videtur!

si illi vixissent] '''''
reading of Halm's MSS. Ernesti conjec-
tured ‘ si vivi vicissent.' “ ⁴ Si illi vixissent,’
Orelli cum Naugerio et cod. Scalae ''
(Halm), who has ‘vivi vicissent) We
must take either Ernesti’s reading or Nau-
gerlus'.
