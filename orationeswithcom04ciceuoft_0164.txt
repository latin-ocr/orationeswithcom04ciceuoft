142 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

modo afficiantur, si liceat eorum cives virtutis caussa in nostram
civitatem venire, tamen hoc ipso inferius esse suum foedus quam
ceterorum, consolabor et 1105 praesentes viros optimos et illam
fidelissimam atque amicissimam nobis civitatem3 simul et vos non
ignorantes, judices, admonebo, quo de jure hoc judicium constitutum
sit, de eo numquam omnino esse dubitatum.

Quos igitur prudentissimos interpretes foederum, quos peritissimos
bellici juris, quos diligentissimos in exquirendis conditionibus civi-
tatum atque caussis esse arbitramur? Eos profecto qui jain*
imperia ac bella gesserunt. XX. Etenim si Q. Scaevola ille augur,
quum de jure praediatorio consuleretur, homo juris peritissimus,
consultores suos nonnumquam ad Furium et Cascellium praediatores
rejiciebat; si nos de aqua nostra Tusculana M. Tugionem potius
quam C. Aquillium consulebamus, quod assiduus usus uni rei deditus
et ingenium et artem saepe vincit, quis dubitet de foederibus et de
toto jure pacis et belli omnibusjuris peritissimis imperatores nostros
anteferre? Possumusne igitur tibi probare auctorem exempli atque
facti illius, quod a te reprehenditur, C. Marium? quaeris aliquem
graviorem, constantiorem, praestantiorem virtute, prudentia, reli-
gione, [aequitate]3 Is igitur, M. Annium Appium, fortissimum

constitutum slt] C. ‘ est’ Halm, Baiter;
‘ est' seems right.-—‘ bellici juris:' in c. 6,
‘ belli jus,’ the more common form, and

(purchasers of such property) and well
versed in all the law about it. There is no
allusion here to the common rules of law

Caesar’s (B. G. i. 44).

20. Q. Scaevola] The ‘augur’ as he
says, the man whom Cicero attached him-
self to when he was young (De Am. c. l).
Scaevola was a great master of law; but
being consulted about a matter which re-
ferred to the ‘jus praediatorium ’ he some-
times referred his clients (consultorem to
two men, who had particularly studied this
branch of laW. Valerius Maximus (viii. 12)
tells the same story. A praediator is de-
fined to be a man who buys lands (praedia)
which have been sold by the state as for-
feited lands. Gaius (ii. 59—61) has some
remarks on a matter os law, in which re-
marks he explains ‘praediator’ thus: ‘⁴ Item
si rem obligatam sibi populus vendiderit,
eamque dominus possederit, concessa est
usureceptio: sed hoc casu praedium biennio
usurecipitur, et hoc est quod vulgo dicitur
ex praediatura possessionem usurecipi ; nam
qui mercatur a populo praediator appellatur.''
In this passage of Cicero ‘praediatores’
seem to be persons acquainted with the
‘jus praediatorium ⁷ as the context shows,
and as Valerius understood the passage.
These men may have been ‘ praediatores ’

about pawning or pledging. The rules of
law applicable to the cases here alluded to
were the rules about property (praedia),
which had been made a security to the
state (see In Verr. ii. 1, c. 54, and the
note) 3 and it may be that these ‘ praedia-
tores' made all the law about ‘praedia'
their particular study. Cascellius is the
name of a jurist whose witty Responsum is
recorded by Macrobius (Ι11 Vatin. c. 15, note).
The jurist Cascellius who is often cited iu
the excerpts in the Digest, was living after
the establishment of Augustus’ power3 and
as this Cascellius is mentioned as contem-
porary with Scaevola the augur and ha'ving
some legal reputati0n‚ he cannot be the
jurist Cascellius unless he attained a very
great age. It has been suggested that he
may have been the jurist's father.

he has made, I suppose, out of the MSS.
