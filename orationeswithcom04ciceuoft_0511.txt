CAP. 10-12, 489

potentiam quidem cujusquam ferre potuit, me auctorem, credo.
desideravit; qui etiam sine his clarissimis viris hanc rem in Cilicia
ad ostium fluminis Cydni confecisset, si.ille ad eam ripam, quam
constituerat, non ad contrariam naves appulisset. Cn. Domitium
non patris interituS, clarissimi viri,¹ non avunculi mors, non Spoliatio
dignitatis ad recuperandam libertatem, sed mea auctoritas exci-
tavit 3 An C. Trebonio ego persuasi? cui ne suadere quidem ausus
essem3 quo etiam majorem ei res publica gratiam debet, qui liber-
tatem populi Romani unius amicitiae praeposuit, depulsorque domi-
natus quam particeps esse maluit. An L. Tillius Cimber me est
auctorem secutus? quem ego magis fecisse illam rem sum adini-
ratus quam facturum putavi, admiratus autem ob eam caussam,
quod immemor beneficiorum, memor patriae fuisset. Quid duos
Servilios—Cascas dicam an Ahalas 3—-et hos auctoritate mea cen-
ses excitatos potius quam caritate rei publicae ἕ Longum est per-
sequi ceteros, idque rei publicae praeelarum3 fuisse tam multos,
ipsis gloriosum.

XII. At quemadmodum me coarguerit homo acutus recor-
damini. Caesare interfecto, inquit, statim cruentum alte extollens

Sicily, but instead of getting popularity, he
was charged with aiming at royal power,
and after he laid down his office he was
condemned and put to death (Livy ii. c. 41).

in Cilicia] There is no other account
of this attempt on the Cydnus. Caesar
marched from Egypt into Syria (De Bello
Alexandrino, c. 33), and from Syria he
went to Tarsus in Cilicia, which is on the
river Cydnus (Id. 66, where there is some
contradiction). His road from the Cydnus
to the table land of Asia was through the
gorge in the Taurus on the upper course of
the Cydnus. The story in Appian is that
when Caesar, after the battle of Pharsalus,
was crossing the Hellespont in small boats.
118 was met by C. Cassius with seventy
triremes, who instead of attacking Caesar
gave up his fleet and begged for mex-cy
(Appian, B. C. ii. c. 88). Comp. Sueten.
Caesar, c. 63; Dion, 42, c. 6. Abrami
has made a very absurd attempt to recon-
8118 Cicero and Appian. The two stories
are different and inconsistent.

ad eam ripam, quam] Halm observes
that the proposition is not repeated with
‘quam;’ and he compares Ad Att. iii. 19,
“ me tuae litterae nunquam in tantam spem
adduxerunt quantam aliorum ;” and other
passages,

Cn. Domitius] He was taken by Caesar
(13.c. 49) in Corfinium together with his

father Lucius, who was Pompeius’ LegatuS.
Caesar set both of them free (B. C. i. 15
and 23). Lucius was in the battle of
Pharsalus against Caesar, and after the
flight he made his escape to the hilis,
where he was found and killed by Caesar's
cavalry (Β. C. iii. c. 99). Lucius married
Porcia, sister of M. Cato Uticensis, who
was accordingly Cn. Domitius' avunculus.

Cneius the son is here said to have been
a conspirator, and Dion (48, c. 7 and 29)
says the same. Suetonius (Nero, c. 3) says
that he was condemned under the Lex
Pedia, though 118 was innocent, and 118 fied
to Brutus in Macedonia. In 11 c. 40 he was
reconciled to Antonius, but he left him sor
the party of Octavianus shortly before the
flght at Actium. l‘lis son L. Domitius mar-
ried Antonia Major, by whom he had a son
Cn. Domitius, who was the father of the
detestable emperor Nem.

Cimber] Ile was the man who in the
senate-house gave the signal sor the attack
on Caesar, by taking hold of his toga and
pulling it down from the neck (Plutarch,
Caesar, c. 66).

Servilios] Publius and Caius Servilius
Casca, two brothers and assassinis. One
os them gave Caesar the tirst bluw (Plu-
tarch, Caesar, c. 66). Cicero says, Shall 1
call them Cascae or Ahalae, worthy imi-
tators of the great Ahala ?
