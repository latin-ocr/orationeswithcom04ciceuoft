CAP. 11, 12. 439
prehendi hominem jussit ad Scaurumque deduci. Vide quid inter-
sit, etsi inique Castorem cum Domitio eomparo; sed tamen ille
inimico servum remisit, tu ab avo abduxisti3 ille incorruptum
audire noluit, tu corrupisti3 ille adjutorem servum eontra dominum
repudiavit, tu etiam accusatorem adhibuisti.—At semel iste est
corruptus a vobis—Nonne, quum esset productus et quum tecum
fuisset, refugit ad legatos? nonne ad hunc Gn. Domitium venit?
nonne audiente hoc Ser. Sulpicio, clarissimo viro, qui tum casu
apud Domitium caenabat, et hoc Τ. Torquato, optimo adolescente,
se a te corruptum, tuis promissis in fraudem impulsum esse con-
fessus est? XII. Quae est ista tam impotens, tam erudelis, tam
immoderata inhumanitas? Idcirco in hanc urbem venisti ut hujus
urbis jura et exempla corrumperes domesticaque immanitate nostrae
civitatis humanitatem inquinares?

At quam acute collecta crimina ! Blesamius, inquit—ejus enim
nomine, optimi viri nee tibi ignoti, maledicebat tibi—ad regem,
inquit, seribere solebat te in invidia esse, tyrannum existimari,

sense right. See Index, Vol. iii. ⁴ Homo.'

At semel] Patricius says ‘qnid autem si
an semel .? ’ But ⁴ At ' is right. Ι1 15 only
a way of saying,—‘ You have corrupted him
more than once 3’ but he puts it in the
form of an objection in some person’s
mouth, ‘ Well, it may be said, you only cor-
rupted him onee.’ And he shows that it
was more than once, and the conclusion
is that such a fellow as Phidippus could not
be believed.

hunc Cn. Domitium] Calvinus, whom
we must suppose to have been present, and
also the learned jurist Ser. Sulpicius (Pro
Murena, Intr‹›d.); unless Cicero, when he
was revising his oration, added a few em-
bellishments of this kind (see Pro Ligario,
0. ll, and the note).

12. impotens] There is also a reading ‘ im-
pudens,y ¹ impotens ’ means ungovernable.
Halm translates ‘ jura et exempla ’ by ⁴ law
and practiee,' which is well enough. But
‘jura ’ 10 the plural is not ⁴ jns,’ which in
one of its senses is LaW. ‘ .hn·a‚' the plural,
has not the meaning of ⁴ leges! Sometimes
it means what we eall ‘ rnles of law,’ many
of which rules are not ⁴ leges‚’ luws or sta-
tutes. We have in fact no exact word for
‘jura ’ in this passage.

ejus nomine] ¹ using his name he was

him that Caesar was unpopular; but this
this was false, and Castor invented the lie
to have an opportunity of saying what he
wished to say, and laying it to the account
of Blesamius.—‘ optimi viri:’ the reading
in the old editions was, and in some 1110-
dern editions still is, ‘optimi hominis?
Lambinus observes that ‘optimus homo,’
‘ bonus homo’ are not usual Latin expres-
sions. Halm quotes only one Ms. as
having ‘ hominis!

statua inter reyes] Dion (43, 0. 45) has
a passage about the statues of Caesar.
There were, he says, seven statues of the
kings in the Capitol, and an eighth of
Brutus the Liberat0r; and Caesar's statne
was placed by the side of Brutus'. The
statues of kings of Rome without Brutus
would hardly have a meaning. These sta-
tues were 00 doubt comparatively modern;
perhaps not more recent than the eonsecra-
tion of the restored Capitol. Suetonius
(Caesar, 0. 76) also speaks of t‘ucsur's
statues. There was nothing strange in
Caesar having a statne, for it hnd long 110011
