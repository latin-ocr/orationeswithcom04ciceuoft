Lex de Ambitu enacted 13.c. 52, in Pom-
peius’ third consulship. The principal
changes which it made in the law De Am-
bitu were in the mode of-procedure. The
‘laudationcs‚’ or testimonies to character,
were suppressed. This was the last Lex
de Ambitu during the Republican period,
as it is called. There was a Lex Julia de
Ambitu passed in the time ot' Augustus,
B.c. 18, and another, as it seems, B.c. 83
but we do not know wherein they differed.
Under Tiberius the farce came to an end
(Tacit. Ann. i. 15), and the Comitia, though
they were not abolished, were only a form
and a show (Dion Cassius, 58, c. 20).

de vi] Under the Lex Plautia.

Bona ejus] ‘Bona' the general term
sor property. His property was sold sub-
ject to all the charges on it. It seems it
was the practice to sell the man's property,
in order to transfer it into other hands,
but the sale would only give the ⁸ bonorum
possessio,’ or the property became the pur-
chaser’s ‘in bonis! For it seems the
Roman law had not devised a direct way
of transferring a man’s propert-y to another
without the consent οἰ the owner. The
purchaser, however, would act· as if he
were owner, and would reduce the property
to money and pay all charges on it. llahn
explains ‘semuncia’ thus: The purchascr
bought Milo’s property for a ‘semuncia,'
or one twenty-fourth of the value, this
small amount. being all that it was worth,
as it was subject to all cha1-ges.—If this is
εο, must we suppose that the purchaser got

this one twenty-fourth for his trouble, if so
much remained after? ‘⁴ The form of this
execution was this: the Praetor directed
the Quaestores to take possession of the
‹lebtor's property (bona possessa), in con-
sequence of which it was considered as pro-
perty that had t'allen to the State (publi-
cata). The Quaestores offered it publiely
and by auction to the highest bidder (bona
proscripta); the property was sold as a
whole, in onc mass, knocked down to the
purchaser (sector), and became his property
on payment of the purchase-money to the
treasury (aerarium).'' (Puchta, Instit. ii.
ξ 179, first ed.)

This does not explain all. The value of
the property might be next to nothing, or
nothing at all. The price therefore would
not satisfy the demands of the ‘aerarium'
If the ⁸ aerarium' had demands, they must
have been satistied out of the produce of
the sale, when the ⁴ sector' had disposed of
the property as he best could. The ques-
tion of the State's priority over other credi-
tors (privilegium) does not concern us here.

1 ain not sure that llalm's explanation is
right. How was the value of the property
to be ascertained before it was sold? lt
was sold sor what it would bring, and sorne-
times a farthing would be enough to give.
Many baukrupts’ estates in Eugluud would
not be worth a farthing to a purclm-w.
The whole matter about the sule ot⁴ pro-
perty under such circumstmwcs us Mihrs,
and the payment of the charges, is perhaps
not fully understood.
