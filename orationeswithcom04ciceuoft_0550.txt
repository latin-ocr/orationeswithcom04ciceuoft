528 ORAT. PHILIPPICARUM LIBER SECUNDUS.

libidinosi, avari, facinorosi verae laudis gustatum non habent. Sed
si te laus allicere. ad recte faciendum non potest, 113 metus quidem
a foedissimis factis potest avocare Ξ Judicia non metuis. Si propter
innocentiam, laudo: sin propter vim, non intelligis, qui isto modo
judicia non timeat, ei quid timendum sit. Quod si non metuis viros
fortes egregiosque cives, quod a corpore tuo prohibentur armis,
tui te, mihi crede, diutius non ferent. Quae est autem vita dies et
noctes timere a suis? nisi vero aut majoribus habes beneficiis obli-

tu es ulla re 01111130 comparandus. Fuit in illo ingenium, ratio,
memoria, litterae, cura, cogitatio, diligentia: res bello gesserat,
quamvis rei publicae calamitosas, at tamen magnas: multos annos

qustalum] ‘gustum ’ D.
quosdam habuit] As C. Trebonius and

ficence was calculated to please and subju-
gate a people who were so corrupted that

L. Tillius Cimber, D. Brutus, and others
whom Caesar had long had about him. M.
Brutus and Cassius, who were of the Pom-
peian faction, had been pardoned‚ but Cicero
may not allude to them. Here he admits
that many of Caesar’s murderers were under
obligations to him. If Caesar deserved his
death, we cannot excuse the men who did it
after receiving favours from 111111.-ι multos
annos ι’ Cicero’s assertion alone would not
make us believe that Caesar's usurpation
was the result of a plan which he had
steadily followed; but all Caesar’s life is
consistent with Cicero’s assertion.
muneribus] He means that Caesar’s
‘ spectacula' (Sueton. Caesar, c. 26 and 39)
were of all kinds, and most expensive. Such
a concourse of people came to see them
that most of the strangers lodged either in
the small places about Rome, or in tents
111 the streets and open parts of the city, and
many were crushed to death 111 the crowds,
two senators among the rest. Caesar en-
larged the old Circus Maximus, which was
made capable of accommodating 260,000
spectators (Plin. 36, 0. 15). This is the
circus which Dionysius (Antiq. Rom. iii.
68) describes. Caesar also built the Forum
Julium more beautiful than the Forum Ro-
manum. It was placed in a very crowded
part of the city, and the ground eost 311
enormons sum of money. In this Forum
Caesar placed the temple of Venus Genetrix,
for which 113 bought at the price of eighty
talents the pictures of Medea and of Ajax
by Timomachus (Plin. 7, c. 38; 35, c. 4).
Other great works which he contemplated
were cut short by his death. This magni-

they cai-ed for nothing but a pittance to live
on and amusement. It is the fashion of new
men, of usurpem, to do such things. They
spend magnificently what they get dis-
honestly.

conqz'arz'is] A ‘congiarium ’ is a vessel
which contains the amount of a ‘ congius‚’
which is a liquid measure of six sextarii.
This measure of 011 or wine was occasion-
ally distributed among the people at Rome;
but in course of time ‘ congiarium ’ meant
any distribution among the people, whether
it was of wine, corn, or money. ⁴ Congi-
aria ’ became common under the empire.
Suetonius (Caesar, c. 38) speaks of Caesar’s
‘ congiaria.' He paid his old soldiers well,
and he gave the people something too. A
modern usurper need not care for the people,
but he must please his soldiers. Caesar
feasted the people, and he distributed meat
among them. After his Spanish victory
(nc. 45) he gave two breakfasts (prandia).
Plutarch, Dion, Pliny, speak of the Dicta-
tor’s hospitality. The wine was of the best
quality. This is the way to gain a stupid
rabble. Dion (43, c. 24) however reports
something about the ⁴ spectacula' after the
African war which can hardly be his inven-
tion. There were people who blamed Cae-
sar for the number of men whose lives were
sacrificed at the ‘spectacula,’ for his insa-
tiate appetite in this matter, and for dis-
playing before the people's eyes the image
of their own sufferings. Stin more did they
blame him for expending countless sums of
money on all these things 3 and 011 two
grounds, that he had got the greater part
of the money by foul means, and that 113
