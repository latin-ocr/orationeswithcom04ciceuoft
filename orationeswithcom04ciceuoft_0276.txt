254 ORAT. PRO CN. PLANCIO

descriptio populi, suffragia largitione devincta, severitatem senatus,
et bonorum omnium vim ac dolorem excitarunt. Haec doce, haec
profer, huc incumbe, Laterensis, decuriasse Plancium, conscripsisse,
sequestrem fuisse, pronuntiasse, divisisse : tum mirabor te iis armis
uti quae tibi lex dabat noluisse. Tribulibus enim judicibus, non
modo severitatem illorum, si ista vera sunt, sed ne vultus quidem
ferre possemus. Hanc tu rationem quum fugeris, quumque eos
judices habere nolueris, quorum in hujus delicto quum scientia cer-
tissima, tum dolor gravissimus esse debuerit, quid apud hos dices,
qui abs te taciti requirunt, cur hoc sibi oneris imposueris, cur se
potissimum delegeris, eur denique se divinare malueris quam eos
qui scirent judicare? XIX. Ego Plancium, Laterensis, et ipsum
gratiosum esse dieo, et habuisse in petitione multos cupidos sui
gratiosos, quos tu si sodales vocas, officiosam amicitiam nomine
inquinas criminoso, sin, quia gratiosi sint, accusandos putas, noli
mirari te id, quod tua dignitas postularit, repudiandis gratiosorum
amicitiis non esse assecutum. Nam ut ego doceo gratiosum esse
in sua tribu Plancium, quod multis benigne fecerit, pro multis spo-
ponderit, in operas plurimos patris auctoritate et grat-ia miserit,

place3 what a number of illegible scrawls;
to say nothing of those who could not
write, and must ask somebody else to write
for them. A fine opportunity for a knave
to write the names of men whom the poor
elector did not wish to vote for, or even
something ‘joculare’ or ‘foedum dictu!
It would be hard to resist the temptation.

It is very likely that the voting was ill
managed, that the secrecy of the ballot was
not always secured, though the object of
the ballot was to secure secrecy; and as
the ballot did not stop bribery, it is pro-
bable that the ingenuity of election agents
devised many fraudulent tricks. Still I do
not think that the voters wrote their names
on the tablets in Cicero’s time.

vim ac dolorem] A usual expression,
says Wunder, who thinks that Cicero would
not have used it if he had not joined
‘ dolor ’ to ‘ vis! Cobet, quoted by Baiter,
proposes ‘iram ’ for ‘vim.’

Haec doce . . . sequestrem] He comes
to the point. Let Laterensis prove his
case3 and ‘ then,’ he says, ⁴ Ι shall wonder
why you did not use the weapons which the
Lex presented to you 3⁷ why you did not
name Plancius’ tribe, and any other tribe
which you say that he had bribed. Ernesti
explains‘ sequestrem' to be him who pro-
mises money for votes, and his own money.

But ‘ sequester' has not this meaning. It
is a man who works for another in the busi-
ness of corruption, who holds the money
and pays it when the work is done. (Verr.
Act l, c. 1⁶2, and the note.) Wunder sup-
poses that Plancius is called ‘sequester'
because he made a coalition (coitio) with
Plotius (c. 22), and in consideration of a
sum of money lodged in his hands, gave up
or sold to Plotius certain tribes, as in like
manner Plotius must be supposed to have
given up to Plancius certain ⁴ tribus? which
he had secured. I do not think that this
explanation is good3 but 1 have none to
offer.

⁴ Pronuntiari ’ means to promise money3
‘ dividere ’ to pay it among the voters.

19. cupidos sui] See Pro Sulla, c. 27,
and the note (Vol. iii.).—-‘ Nam ut ego ε’
Τ. Ε. have ‘ Nam! Wunder has ‘ Jam.’

spoponderit] ⁴ He had become security
for many. ’ (Pro Quintio, c. 23, Vol. ii.)
In order to secure his election Plancius had
prepared the way by helping people in
their difficulties ; and he had got places for
many through his father s influenee. Cicero
who says this, of course considered it one of
the fair ways of getting popularity. The
influence of Plancius' father as a great man
among the publicani, found places for many
as collectors to the Societates, clerks and
