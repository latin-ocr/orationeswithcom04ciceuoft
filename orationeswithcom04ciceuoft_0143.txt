CA P. 1—3. 121

hoc satis esse caussae, ut quod fecisse On. Pompeium constet id
omnes ei licuisse concedant. Nam verius nihil est quam quod
hesterno die dixit ipse, ita L. Cornelium de fortunis omnibus
dimicare ut nullius in delicti crimen vocaretur. Non enim furatus
esse civitatem, non genus suum ementitus, non in aliquo impudenti
mendacio delituisse, non irrepsisse in censum dicitur ε unum objicitur
natum esse Gadibus, quod negat nemo. Cetera accusator fatetur,
hunc in Hispania durissimo bello cum Q. Metello, cum C. Memmio
et in classe et in exercitu fuisse; ut Pompeius in Hispaniam
venerit Memmiumque habere quaestorem coeperit, numquam a
Memmio discessisse, Karthagine esse obsessum,acerrimis illis praeliis
et maximis Sucronensi et Turiensi interfuisse, cum Pompeio ad
extremum belli tempus fuisse. Haec sunt praelia Cornelii: talis in
rem publicam nostram labor, assiduitas, dimicatio, virtus digna
summo imperatore, spes pro periculis praemiorum. Praemia quidem
ipsa non suntin ejus facto qui adeptus est, sed in ejus qui dedit.
ΙΙΙ. Donatus igitur est ob eas caussas a Cn. Pompeio civitate. Id
accusator non negat, sed reprehendit, ut in Cornelio caussa ipsius

irrepsisse in censum] Being included in
the census would be evidence of citizenship;
and to get on the census without being en-
titled to it would be a fraud. There is a
note on ‘incensus ' in the Pro Caecina, c.
34, Vol, ii.

durissimo bello] In the war against Ser-
torius. Metellus Pius was sent first, aud as
he could not bring the war to an end,
Cn. Pompeius, then a young man and only
an eques, was sent to help Metellus. C.
Memmius was thehusband of Cu. Pompeius’
sister.

Karthaqz'ne esse obsessum] This is Mad-
vig’s emendation, and nothing better can be
made out of the ⁴ isse ' or ‘ esse possessum ¹
or ‘ possessum csse' of the MSS. Cicero
says in the next chapter ‘nullius obses-
sionis.' Carthago is Carthago Nova in
Hispania Ulterior.

Sucronensi et Turiensi] The battle on
the Sucro (Xucar) was fought between Ser-
torius and PompeiuS, who began his Spanish
campaign in 13.c. 76. That on the Turia
was fought by Sertorius against Metellus
and Pompeius together (Plutarch, Sertorius,
c. 19, where the common reading is Tuttia,
which is incon-rect). In the battle on the
Sucro Pompeius was wounded and nearly
lost his life. The two battles are rnen-
tioned in Pompeius' letter to the Roman
senate (Sallust, [list. iii.) : “Castra hostium
apud Sucronem capta, ct praelium apud

flumen Durium et dux hostium C. Heren-
nius cum urbe Valentia et exercitu deleti,
satis clara sunt '’ (Ed. Cort.). The readings
of C. are ‘Duriensi.' Vossius in his note
on Mela (ii. 6) supposes that Cicero thought
this river Turia to be the same as the
Durius. But it is a simpler matter to sup-
pose that ¹ Duricnsi ’ should either be ⁴ Tu-
riensi,' or that no distinction was some-
times made between the names of the
Durius and Turia, though it might be well
known that they were different rivers. There
is no doubt that the Durius (Duero) is not
meant, and that the river is the Turis or
Turia, the Guadalaviar, which flows past
Valentia. In a fragment of the second book
of Sallust's llistory, we find “ flumen Tu-
riam quod Valentiam parvo intervallo prae-
terfluit.'’

'Haec sunt praelia Cornelii] ⁴ Praclia ' is
the reading of C. Klotz proposes ⁴ propria ’
for ‘praelia,' because ‘propria Cornelii’
occurs in the next chapter, and Baiter t'ol-
lows him. Madvig erased ¹ praelia.'—⁸ non
sunt in ejus facto,' &c.: the merit was
Balbus', but. the rewards were the act of
him who gave them.

3. ut in Cornelio] The prosecutor does
not dcny the fact, but hc censuros it: and
the result is that in the person of Cornelius
his merit is admitted, but an attempt is
made to inflict a penalty on him; in tho
person of Pompeius the case is <iniungat
