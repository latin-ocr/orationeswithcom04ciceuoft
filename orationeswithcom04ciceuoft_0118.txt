96 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

Albucius, quod a senatu petebat, ipse sibi in Sardinia ante decre·
verat. Constabat enim Graecum hominem ac levem in ipsa pro-
vincia quasi triumphasse: itaque hanc ejus temeritatem senatus
supplicatione denegata notavit. Sed fruatur sane hoc solatio, atque
hanc insignem ignominiam, quoniam uui praeter se inusta est,
putot csse leviorem, dummodo, cujus exemplo se consolatur, ejus
exitum exspectet: praesertim quum in Albucio nec Pisonis libidines
nec audacia Gabinii fuerit, ac tamen hac una plaga conciderit,
ignominia senatus.

Atqui duas Gallias qui decernit consulibus duobus, hos retinet
ambo: qui autem alteram Galliam et aut Syriam aut Macedoniam,
tamen alterum retinet et in utriusque pari scelere disparem con-
ditionem facit. Faciam, inquit, illas praetorias, ut Pisoni et Ga-
binio succedatur statim. Si hic sinat: tum enim tribunus inter-
cedere poterit ; nunc non potest. Itaque ego idem, qui nunc con-
sulibus iis, qui designati erunt, Syriam Macedoniamque decerno,
decernam easdem praetoriaS, ut et praetores annuas provincias

Fin. i. e. 3, he quotes some verses of Lu-
cilius on the praetor Scaevola saluting Al-
bucius at Athens in Greek.

ejus emitum] Albucius was prosecuted
by C. Julius Strabo for Peculatus, tried and
convicted. He went into exile and resided
at Athens very happy and contented (Cicero,
Tusc. v. c. 37): ⁴⁴ Quid T. Albucius nonne
animo aequissimo Athenis philosophabatur,
cui tamen illud ipsum non accidisset, siin
re publica quiescens Epicuri legibus paruis-
set ?'’

Atqui duas Gallias] Some senator had
proposed to give the two Galliae, Caesar's
two provinces, to the consuls who should be
elected that year, and if this had been done,
Caesar would have been superseded. Some
proposed to take one province from him,
and either Syria from Gabinius or Mace-
donia from Piso 3 but Cicero says, this
would be treating two men differently,
though they were both equally deserving of
being recalled.

Faciam, inquit] He who had proposed
to take the two Galliae for the consuls
who were going to be elected, is supposed
to reply to Cicero’s objection : ‘¹ Ι will make
them (Syria and Macedonia) praetorian, the
consequence of which will be that Piso and
Gabinius will be immediately supe1·seded.”
Cicero rejoins: ‘⁴ Yes, if he who is here
(pointing to him) will allow‚” the tribune
to whom he pointed3 ‘⁴ for then he will in-
terpose his veto 3 now he cannot.” He

could not put his veto on the nomination of
the two consular provinces. In place of
⁴ si hic sinat ’ Halm proposed ⁴ si hoc sina-
tur‚' which Baiter has prudently not ac-
cepted.

decernam easdem] Cicero proposes to
give Syria and Macedonia to the Consules
designati of that year, but as they could not
enter on their province until the year of
their consular office was expired, he says he
will also move that praetors have these pro-
vinces for one year, for the next year, so
that Gabinius and Piso would be imme-
diately superseded. But he tells us in the
beginning of the next chapter that such a
motion would be useless, and that Piso and
Gabinius will never be superseded, except
by means of the Sempronia Lex, by means
of the Lex which gave the senate the power
of naming annually two Consulares Provin-
ciae, and to which the tribunes could offer
no opposition. But this being so, Piso and
Gabinius would still stay a year in their pro-
vinces, foris their provinces were assigned
to the consuls going to be elected, there
would still intervene about eighteen months
between their election and their entering on
the provinces; which has been explained
before—⁴ tempore amisso :’ if we lose this
opportunity through the tribunitian inter-
cessio, we shall not be able to send a suc-

cessor before a whole year has passed
(Abrami).
