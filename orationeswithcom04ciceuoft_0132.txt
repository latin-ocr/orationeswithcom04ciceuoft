110 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

sit gloriam consecutus, ei nc libertatem quidem relinquat, adduci ad
suspicandum nullo modo possum. Postremo quo quisque animo
futurus sit nescio: quid sperem video. Praestare hoc senator
debeo quantum possum, ne quis vir clarus aut potens huic ordini
jure irasci posse videatur. Atque haec, si inimicissimus essem O.
Caesari, sentirem tamen rei publicae caussa.

XVII. Sed non alienum esse arbitror quo minus saepe aut in-
terpeller a nonnullis aut tacitorum existimatione reprehendar, ex-
plicare breviter quae mihi sit ratio et caussa cum Caesare. Ac.
primum illud tempus, familiaritatis et consuetudinis, quae mihi cum
illo, quae frat-ri meo, quae C. Varroni, consobrino nostro, ab om-
nium nostrum adolescentia fuit, praetermitto. Posteaquam sum
penitus in rem publicam ingressus, ita dissensi ab illo ut in disjunc-
tione sent-entiae conjuncti tamen amicitia maneremus. Consul ille
egit eas res quarum me participem esse voluit, quibus ego si minus
assentiebar, tamen illius mihi judicium gratum esse debebat. Me
ille ut quinqueviratum acciperem rogavit3 me in tribus sibi con-
junctissimis consularibus esse voluit3 mihi legationem quam vellem
quanto cum honore vellem detulit. Quae ego omnia non ingrato
animo, sed obstinatione quadam sententiae repudiavi. Quam sapi-

has a sense which may be easily derived
from the context. So Sallust says (Jug.
c. 63) : “Etiam tum alios magistratus plebes,
consulatum nobilitas inter se per manus
tradebat.’'

17. O. Varroni] He mentions C. Visel-
lius Varro in the Brutus (c. 76). He had
some oratorical power, and knowledge of the
Roman law, which he got from his father,
C. Aculeo, who married Helvia, the sister
of Cicero’s mother (De Or. ii. l). C. Varro
is mentioned in the Verrine orations (Act. i.
c. 28 .

quinqueviratum] Manutius proposes to
read ‘ vigintiviratum‚ as we read in the
letters to Atticus (ii. 3 and 6), in Quintilian
(xii. l), in Velleius (ii.45)‚ and in Suetonius,
who says that M. Atius Balbus, the husband
of Caesar’s sister, was one of the xxviri for
the division of the Campanian land under
the Lex Julia. Baiter says ‘ vigintiviratum,
Ant. Augustinus‚’ and he seems to have in-
tended to put it in his text, though he has
‘ quinqueviratum.' He refers to Mommsen
in Die Schriften der rom. Feldmesser, ii. p.
2:24. Mommsen says, speaking of these
xxviri, “instead of these twenty men five men
are mentioned (Cic. Ad Att. ii. 7. De Prov.
Cons. c. 17), whether it was that the num-
ber was afterwards limited, or that the
twenty were divided into four subcommis-

sions, and sometimes they said xxvir
sometimes vvir, just as xxvivir and xvir
lit. jud. are both said.'' Drumann (ii.
231, note) reconciles the contradiction
by saying that there were twenty commis-
sioners and a select number of five out of
the twenty who formed the chief part of the
commission, and that Dion (38, c. l)
plainly alludes to this. But the allusion is
not so plain to me.

tribus sibi] Caesar’s son-in-law Cn.
Pompeius was one, M. Crassus another, and
Cicero would make the third. Manutius
and others make Piso, Caesar’s father-in-
laW, one of them3 but Cicero says ‘ consu-
laribus,' and Piso had not been consul in
13.c. 59, the year of Caesar's consulship and
of the Lex J ulia about the Campanian lands.
—‘ legationem :' Cicero tells Atticus (Ad
Att. ii⁴ 18 and 19), that Caesar had invited
him to be one of his legati, and also that a
‘libera legatio voti caussa' was offered to
him. He calls Caesar's protection a ⁴ popu-
lare praesidium‚’ and it would have been a
protection against the ‘ popularis impetus '
of Clodius. Cicero refused every offer of
Caesar. In a letter to his wife written in
his exile he says: “ Meum fuit officium vel
legatione vitare periculum vel diligentia et
copiis resistere, vel cadere fortiter'' (Ad
Fam. xiv. 3).
