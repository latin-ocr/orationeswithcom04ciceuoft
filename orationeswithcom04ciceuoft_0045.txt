OAP. 11. 23

magistratus, multas jam alias tulisses, exspectarisne dum G. Anto-
nius reus fieret apud Cn. Lentulum Clodianum? et posteaquam ille
est reus factus, statim tuleris in eum ‘⁵ qui tuam post legem reus
factus esset‚” ut homo consularis exclusus miser puncto temporis
spoliaretur beneficio et aequitate legis tuae? Dices familiaritatem
tibi fuisse cum Q. Maximo. Praeclara defensio facinoris tui. Nam
Maximi quidem summa laus est, sumptis inimicitiis, suscepta caussa,
quaesitore consilioque delecto, commodiorem inimico suo conditio-
nem rejectionis dare noluisse. Nihil Maximus fecit alienum aut
sua virtute aut illis viris clarissimis, Paullis, Maximis, Africanis,
quorum gloriam hujus virtute renovatam non modo speramus,
verum etiam jam videmus. Tua fraus, tuum maleficium, tuum scelus
illud est, te id, quod promulgasses misericordiae nomine, ad crude-
litatis tempus distulisse. Ac nunc quidem O. Antonius hac una re
miseriam suam consolatur, quod imagines patris et fratris sui,

the meaning of ‘in’ in this passage.

nius could not do what was good without
also doing what was bad, for by the terms
of his Lex ‘qui tuam’ δια, 118 deprived
C. Antonius of the advantage of it: he
waited till the prosecution of C. Antonius
had been commenced by Q. Fabius Maxi-
mus and M. Caelius Rufus, before he pro-
mulgated his Lex. The critics have not
agreed what offence C. Antonius was tried
for, but it seems that he was tried for Repe-
tundae, having been guilty of it 111 his go-
vernment of Macedonia. Dion Cassius (38,
c. 10) says that 118 was not tried for mal..
versation in his province, but for his share
in the conspiracy of Catilina, and yet 118
was convici-ed on account of his malversation
in his provincc; a most absurd statement.
Drumann affirms that 118 was tried and con-
victed on two charges; and 118 infers this
from a passage 111 the Pro Caelio (c. 7).
Zumpt refers to the Schol. on the Pro
Flacco, p. 22³), Or., where it is said that 118
was 111-0588111811 by Caelius and convicted,
not only of Repetundae, but also on account
of the affair of Catilina. The affair of Cati-
lina then helped to his condemnation, but
he was not tried for it ; and so Dion's story
is untrue. Zumpt remarks that hc could
not have been convicted of a share in the
conspiracy of Catilina. because after An-
tonius' conviction the sepulchre of Catilina
was adorned with flowers, as if his Manes
had got satisfaction by Antonius’ condem-
nation (Pro Flacco, 38, and the note).

Q. Fabius Maximus, one of C. Antonius’
prosecutors, was his reason for depriving
Antonius of the benetit of the Lex Vatinia;
as if he wished to oblige Maximus in this
matter.—‘ commodiorem ' 810. : that 15, he
did not choose to wait for the enactment of
the Lex which had been promulgated, for if
he had done so, 118 would have given his
enemy the advantage of the ‘rejectio‘ or

Maximus, and this son was the father of C.
Antonius’ prosecutor. The younger Afri-
canus was also a son of L. Aemilius Paullus,
and was adopted by a son os the elder Afri-
canus (Manutius) ; who says that this
Paullus was adopted by a son of Africanus
Minor, which is a slight mistake, but llalm
reprints Manutius' note without eorrecting it.
Africanus Major married Aemilia, who was
a daughter of L. Aemilius Paullus who fell
at Cannae, and the sister of Paullus the
conqueror of Macedonia.
