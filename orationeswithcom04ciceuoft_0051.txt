CAP. 14, 15. 29

de te quo tandem senatusconsulto legatus sis? De gestu intelligo
quid respondeas: tua lege dicis. Esne igitur patriae certissimus
parricida? spectarasne id, ut patres conscripti ex re publica funditus
tollerentur? Ne hoc quidem senatui relinquebas, quod nemo um-
quam ademit, ut legati ex ejus ordinis auctoritate legarentur?
Adeone tibi sordidum consilium publicum visum est, adeo afflictus
senatuS, adeo misera et prostrata res publiea, ut non nuntios pacis
ac belli, non oratores, non interpretes, non bellici consilii auctores,
non ministros muneris provincialis senatus more majorum deligere
possit? Eripueras senatui provinciae decernendae potestatem, im-
peratoris deligendi judicium, aerarii dispensationem; quae num-
quam sibi populus Romanus appetivit, qui numquam aut summi
consilii gubernationem auferre conatus est. Age, factum est horum

him a legatus; but Cicero says every thing
obscurely that relates to Caesar. Halm
observes that it is strange that Cicero did
not lay this also to the charge of Vatinius,
that immediately after his tribunate he held
a legatio in an army under an impe-
rator who was appointed by his own Lex.
See De Imp. Cn. Pompeii, c. 19, note.
Vol. ii.—¹ esne igitur:' ‘ are you not then ?'
This is often the meaning of this form of
expression. Comp. ‘Videsnemess c. 12.

ut teqati . . . leqarentur] The Schol.
has this note: ‘⁴ Nullo jure Vatinium dicit
in legationem esse profectum, quum soleat
hoc a senatu peti, ut praesides provinciarum
possint quos velint amicos suos habere
legatos. Hunc igitur summa impudentia
non auctoritatem senatus expectasse, sed
quodam jure privato tantam licentiam sibi
depoposcisse.’' Drumann (v. p. 688, n. 64)
observes, ⁴ not Vatinius, who as the weaker
person again furnishes the name, but Caesar
had assumed the nomination.’

P. Vatinius is mentioned as one of Cae-
sar’s legati in the eighth book of the Gallie
War (c. 46), and no where else. He is first
mentioned therefore in the Gallie War in
ac. 51.

non numios] In this rhetorical passage
the various functions of ‘legati’ are men-
tioned. The reading ⁴ oratores ’ is Guliel-
mius' excellent emendation confirmed by
the lemma of the Scholiast. The common
reading is=‘curatores‚’ which word is not
nsed alone except to signify the ‘ curatores ⁷
of ⁴ furiosi 'and of those who are ⁵ minores ’
(Madvig, quoted by Halm).

bellici consilii] The ‘legati ’ arc reprc-
sented as adviscrs to the ‘ imperator ' in war,
as well as iu the ordinary administration of
a province; and it has been observed that.

Polybius and other writers sometimes call
them πρεσβευτάς and sometimes πρεσβευ-
τὰς καὶ συμβούλους.-· deligere possit:'
this is the MSS. reading. But the editions
and Halm have ⁴ deligere posset.’—‘ eripu-
eras senatui :’ by his Lex de Imperio Cae-
saris, for the appointment to the consular
provinces belonged to the Senate according
to the Lex Sempronia (B.c. l‘23; Cic.
Verr. ii. 3, c. 95, Vol. i.). The ⁴ dispensatio
aerarii‘ seems to be, as Halm says, the
money given to Caesar when he received
his proconsular government. This was pro-
bably a considerable sum, for without great
means he could not have maintained the
four legions which were given him and the
two new legions which he raised (B. G. 1.
10) in order to conduct his campaign
against the Helvetii. Besides these legions
he had numerous auxiliaries.

quae numquam sibi . . . conatus est]
Halm (cd. 1856) writes ‘quac numquam
populus ab summi consilii gubernatione
auferre conatus est.' In his earlier edition
he retains the words ⁴ quae numquam sibi
populus Romanus appetivit ;‘ and he oh-
serves that Sallust (.lug. c. 37) says that thc
Populus appointed Marius to the command
in the war against Jugurtha, though the
Senate had already given the command to
Metellus; and Cicero says afterwards that
this had been donc before. 1t was dolie by
the Lex Gabinia, which gave Cn. Pompeius
the command against the pirates, and by
the Lex Manilia (De Imp. Cn. Pompeii),
which gave him the command against
Mithridates. The reading in the text is
corrupt, as the word ⁴ aut ¹ shows.

Aqe.sac!11m est] This is 11 concessioni:
⁴ well, granted that something of this· kind
was done in other cases! The subjunctixc
