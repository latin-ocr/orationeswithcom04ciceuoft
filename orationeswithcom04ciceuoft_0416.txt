394 ORAT. PRO M. MARCELLO

num, Oceanum, Nilum, pugnas innumerabiles, incredibiles victorias,
monumenta, munera, 'triumphos audientes et legentes tuos. Sed
nisi haec urbs stabilita tuis consiliis et institutis erit, vagabitur
modo nomen tuum longe atque late, sedem [quidem] stabilem ct
domicilium certum non habebit. Erit inter eos etiam qui nas-
centur, sicut inter nos fuit, magna dissensio, quum alii laudibus ad
caelum res tuas gestas efferent, alii fortasse aliquid requirent,
idque vel maximum, nisi belli civilis incendium salute patriae*
restinxeris, ut illud fati fuisse videatur, hoo consilii. Servi igitur
iis etiam judicibus, 'qui multis post saeculis de te judicabunt,
et quidem haud scio an incorruptius quam nos; nam et sine amore
et sine cupiditate, et rursus sine odio et sine invidia judicabunt.
Id autem etiamsi tum ad te, ut quidam falso putarit, non perti-

idque vel maximum] These words re-
fer to ⁴ nisi belli . . . restinxeris‚’ which Pa-
tricius explains ⁴ id est si non restinxeris.'
⁶ Restrinxeris ' F. M. (sed in F. superscr.
restinoeeris)‚ Baiter. But as Patricius re-
marks “salute restinyuere miro quodam
modo dicitu1·.”-‘ ut illud ε’ ‘ and the con-
sequence will be that all your glorious vic-
tories (iuud) will be attributed to fate, but
the re-establishment of order (urbe stabilita,
840.) will be considered the work of wisdom.'

haud scio an incorruptius] Cicero has
a like expression in the long letter of ad-
vice to his brother when Quintus was in
Asia (Ad Qu. Fr. i. l, c. 15).

sine cupiditate] ‘ without passion or
party spirit! So Tacitus (Ann. i. 1) says
that he wrote his Annales “sine ira et
studio quorum caussas procul habeo.”

ut quidamfalso putant] The words ‘ad
te . . . non pertinebit,’ litei-ally, ⁶ will not
extend to you,’ contain by implication the
assertion of the mortality of the whole man.
‘ Ad se pertinere’ was a legal term to ex-
press a title to a thing (Gaius iii. 9 ; Cicero,
Top. c. 3). Cicero is alluding to the great
dispute whether there is any thing in man
that survives death or the dissolution of
the organized body. But before we attempt
to answer this question, we must say what
death is. Anaxagoras and Euripides said
wisely

θνήσκει δ’ οὐδὲν, μεταμειβόμενα δ’ ἄλλο
πρὸς ἄλλο μορφὰς ἔδειξεν.

(Plut. De Plac. Phil. v.: as the words stand
in Wyttenbach’s ed.) The opinion of the
reflecting men among the Greeks and Ro-
mans was divided on this matter. The popu-
lar belief seems to have been that something

remained after death, and that it existed
either in a state os happiness or unhappi-
ness. Plutarch (De Placit. Phil. iv.) has
collected some of the philosophical opinions
on the nature of the ψυχὴ. Pythagoras
and Plato said that it was imperishable, and
that when it leaves the body it returns to
the soul of the universe, to that which is
of the same kind with itself (πρὸς τὸ ὁμο-
γενὲς). But it was only the reasonable
part (τὸ λογικόν) which did not perish, for
the ψυχή was not divine &erim—perhaps
they mean nota self-subsisting divine thing,
—but the work of the eternal God: the
unreasonable part was perishablc. The
Stoic doctrine is very vague. Democritus
and Epicurus distinctly assert that the
ψυχὴ 15 dissolved with the body. I do
not see that the doctrine of most of the
Greek philosophers implies a personal and
distinct existence after death, but Socrates
had this notion‚ and others (Plutarch. De
Sera Numinis Vindicta, c. 18). The po-
pular opinion, as we see it iu Homer's
Odyssey, gives to the dead a separate exist-
ence. The popular notion however of a
separate existence was vague, and, as I
have said, many of the philosophers and
thinking men did not entertain it. Cicero’s
own notions were confused.

Ι do not recollect ever having seen fairly
discussed the question of the practical
effect on human life of a decided opinion
for or against the immortality of the soul.
The common feeling, the ‘communis sen-
sus‚’ of most nations, but perhaps not all,
is that man will exist in another state after
this, but the mode in which this existence
is conceived varies in different nations and
even in people of the same nation. In
