diis immortalibus non erat exigua eadem gratulatio quae ex
maximis bellis. Ergo ille cumulus dierum hominis est dignitati
tributus. In quo ego, quo consule referente primum decem dierum est

omnibus esset omni honore antelatus, ampliorem honorem alteri
tribuebat quam ipse erat consecutus. Ergo in illa supplicatione
quam ego decrevi, res ipsa tributa est diis immortalibus et majorum
institutis et utilitati rei publicae3 sed dignitas verborum, honos, et
novitas, et numerus dierum Caesaris ipsius laudi gloriaeque con-

proposed the fifteen days. He voted for when the Armoric states had revolted, and
them. Yet in the Pro Balbo, c. 27, he he had to build a fleet to oppose them. He

seems to say that he proposed it.

0. Mario] After the Cimbrian war. We
may conclude that the supplicatio was five
days, as Pompeius had ten days after the end
of the Mithridatio war. There are nume-
rous instances of supplicationes in Livy,
but there seems to have been no rulc about
the number of days. When Aemilius Paullus
defeated Perseus, king of Macedonia, the
supplicatio was five days (Liv. 45, c. 2);
and this was longer than usual. So if
Marius had five days, and Pompeius had
teu, Caesar's supplicatio was a triple num-
ber. In Bc. 55 he had a supplicatio of
twenty days (B. G. iv. 38). The five days
was the utmost limit ofa consular supplicatio
as it seems in former times3 for Livy, after
speaking of the five days’ supplicatio of
Aemilius Paullus speaks in the next chapter
of a three days’ supplicatio for lllyrian vic-
tories gained by two legati of the praetor
L. Anicius.

dierum duodecim] P. has ⁸ deorum ’ for

says (B. G. iii. 9) : “ Naves interim longas
aedificari in flumine Ligere‚ quod influit in
Oceanum, remiges ex Provincia institui,
nautas gubernatoresque comparari jubet.’'
The preparation for the war with the Veneti
must have been very expensivc. In the
winter of arc. 57 and the beginning of ue.
56 Caesar was in Illyricum and North Italy.
Cicero (Ad Fam. i. 7) writing to Lentulus
Procos. says: “ Itaque perpaucis adversan-
tibus omnia quae nc per populum quidem
sine seditione se assequi arbitrabantur. per
senatum consecuti sunt ; nain et stipendium
Caesari decretum est et decem legati et ne
lege Sempronia succederetur facilc perfectum

and the note, Vol. iii. It was of course
necessary that some senators should he prc-
