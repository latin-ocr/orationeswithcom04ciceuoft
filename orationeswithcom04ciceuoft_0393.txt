deinde adoptatum esse ab C. Annio avo
suo materno. Tertium patrimonium vi-
detur significare matris, aliud enim quod
fuerit non invenio'' (Ascon.). Halm bids
us observe how the art of the orator suc-
ceeds in giving even a favourable side to
the illegal bribery of Milo. Abrami refers
to a passage in Cicero’s letters (Ad Q. Fr.
iii. 9, §2), in which he expresses his real
opinion of Milo’s profusion: “Angit unus
Milo, sed velim finis afferat consulatus, in
quo enitar non minus quam sum enisus in
nostro. De quo caetera, nisi plane vis
eripuerit, recte sunt: de re familiari timeo:
ὁ δὲ μαίνεται οὐκέτ’ ἀνεκτῶς, qui ludos
ns cccmoo comparet.'’ Milo spent his
money and got deep in debt: “Ipsum
Milonem sestertium septingenties aeris
alieni debuisse inter prodigia animi humaui
duco'' (Plin. 36, c. 15, quoted by Abrami).
We must suppose that he borrowed money
on the prospect of the consulship, and his
creditors like modern usurers ran the risk,
for it is certain that they were never paid.
Caesar laid out his money more success-
fully. Cicero delivered a speech in the
senate (n.c. 53) intitled ⁴ Interrogatio de
Aere alieno Milonis‚' in answer to an attaek
of P. Clodius on Milo. Mai has pub-
lished a fragment of a commentary on this
speech, which commentary he supposes to
be by Asconius Pedianus. The Argu-
mentum explains the occasion and the
object of Cicero's speech: “Cum igitur
obnixe contenderet Clodius non oportere
qui magno aere alieno defaeneratus praedae
videretur habiturus esse remp„ contradixit
ejus insectationi M. Cicero, qui familiaritate
praecipua Milonem diligebat ob id maxime
meritum, quod restitutionem suae digni-
tatis ab eodem tribuno plebis meminerat
adjutam.”

vestrorum ordinum] The Equites and
the Tribuni Aerarii, the representatives of
the Plebs, for the senate has been already
mentioned (Halm).

praeconis] The Praeco proclaimed the
result of the elections, and the presiding
magistrate formally declared the successful
candidates (renuntiavit). Pro Murena, c. l.
There was no formal election in Milo’s
case, for the election was imm-rupted, as
some say; or Cicero merely means that
the people had shown how they would
vote. He is speaking ‘oratorios—‘haec
arma:' the troops which Pompeius had
placed about the Forum during this trial
(c. l). The ⁴ facinoris suspicionem' is some
suspicion of Milo having a design against
Cn. Pompeius' life, or against the State, as
Abrami explains it. The ‘sacti crimen,’
‘a charge founded on what he had done,’
the death of Clodius.

non tam praemia] This is probably
some philosophical theme which Cicero
laid hold of for the occasion—that good
men do not seek a reward for their good-
ness, but rather do what they do, because
it is right to do it. Abrami supposes that
Seneca (De Benef. i. c. l) had this passage
before him, because he says the same
thing. In another passagessu'p. 81) Seneca
says it well: “Virtutum omnium pretium
in ipsis est, non enim exercentur ad prae-
mium. Recte facti fecisse merces est.'' It
is not an unmeaning doctrine. though it
may have been preaehed by men who did
not practise it. and though Cicero may
have used it for mere rhetorical effect.
He says many good things, which his great
reading furnished him with, but his prac-
tice was very much below his preat-hing.
The highest virtue that we can conceive is
the virtue which has its satisfaction in the
virtuous act or in the virtuous life, claime
nothing more as a consequence, and looks
to nothing more as a motivo. “ Epictetus-⁰
says Mrs. emtor, “strongly insists that a
bad man hath no other punislunvnt llum
being such, and a good man no other
reward'’ (Β. i. c. 12, p. (36³ 13. 111· C· 7.

p. 36, δια), ln a note she adds “The
