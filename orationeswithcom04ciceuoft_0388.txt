366 ORAT. PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE
viderunt, commovisse se videntur, et jus in illo suum retinuisse.
Vos enim jam, Albani tumuli atque luci, VOS, inquam, imploro atque
obtestor, vosque, Albanorum obrutae arae, sacrorum populi Ro-
mani sociae et aequales, quas ille praeceps amentia caesis prostra-
tisque sanctissimis lucis substructionum insanis molibus oppres—
serat: vestrae tum arae, vestrae religiones viguerunt, vestra vis
valuit, quam ille omni scelere polluerat ; tuque ex tuo edito monte,
Latiaris sancte Juppiter, cujus ille lacus, nemora finesque saepe*
omni nefario stupro et scelere macularat, aliquando ad eum puni-
endum oculos aperuisti, vobis illae, vobis vestro in conspectu
serae, sed justae tamen et debitae poenae solutae sunt: nisi sorte
hoc etiam casu factum esse dicemus, ut ante ipsum sacrarium
Bonae Deae, quod est in fundo Τ. Sextii Galli, in primis honesti et
ornati adolescentis, ante ipsam, inquam, Bonam Deam, quum prae-
lium commisisset, primum illud vulnus acciperet quo taeterrimam
mortem obiret, ut non absolutus judicio illo nefario videretur, sed
ad hanc insignem poenam reservatus. XXXII. Nec vero non
eadem ira deorum hanc ejus satellitibus injecit amentiam, ut sine
imaginibus, sine cantu atque ludis, sine exsequiis, sine lamentis,

bearing on the speech, except so far as it
makes Clodius guilty of the same offence
as if he had violated the sanctity of Roman
temples and altars. Religion caused no
difficulty to the Romans in the conquest of
the Italian nations and of the Greeks3 and
indeed the Romans very freely admitted
the gods and ceremonial even of some bar-
barous nations; for instance. they brought
the worship of the Mater Deorum from
Phrygia to Rome (Vol. iii., De Harusp.
Resp. c. 13). Two nations however had a
system that could not be reconciled to the
Roman, the Druidism of Gallia, and the
religion of the Jews. The Romans at-
tempted to extirpate Druidism from Gallia;
and it was the question of religion which
raised the bloody wars with the Jews in
the time of Vespasian and of Hadrian.

vestrae tam arae] The word ‘arae’ is
omitted by Baiter, following Gruter. Bake
would change ‘ quam ille’ into ‘quas ille,'
for Clodius could not be said ‘vim pol-
luere,’ but ‘ religiones.'

Latiaris] or ⁴ Latialis.5 There are both
readings, and they are equally good. J upi—
ter’s temple was on the summit of the
Alban hills.

“ Et residens celsa Latialis Jupiter Alba.'’
(Lucan, i. 198.)

“ On the summit of Monte Cavo (Mons

Albanus) there is now the monastery of the
Passionists, on the site of the old temple of
Jupiter. The last remains of this celebrated
building, where the Latin States celebrated
yearly the Feriae Latinae, were destroyed
about forty years ago, and the huge stones
of the wall were used for making an enclo-
sure to the garden of the monastery, and
for similar purposes. The summit is about
3000 feet high, and commands a view of
all the coast from Terracina to Capo
Linaro, near Civitii Vecchia. The two
lakes of Albano and Nemi (Albanus et
Nemorensis), which seem to lie almost
perpendicularly below the mountain top,
present a singular appearance; they look
like two huge spectacle glasses'' (Westphal,
Die Romische Kampagne, p. 35, A.D. 1829).

Bonae Deae] “ Occurrit ei circa horam
nonam Clodius paulo ultra Bovillas rediens
ab Aricia prope eum locum in quo Bonae
Deae sacellum est'’ (Asconius, Introd.)‚—-
‘ T. Sextii Galliz' ‘ T. Sergii Galli,' Baiter;
T. E, have ‘ Serti :' P. has ⁴ Sergi! ‘¹ Libri
calamo exarati in Germania Sertii, et vero
Cn. Sertiz' mentio in Verrem lib. ii. cap. 48 '⁷
(Gruter). See Verr. ii. 2, c. 48, and the note
on ‘ Cn. Sertium.'—‘ illo judicio:’ the noto-
rious trial of Clodius for violating the mys-
teries of the Bona Dea. Clodius had been
acquitted on this trial (c. 5).
