lege, necessitate.

ORAT. PRO ΟΝ. PLANCIO

Non valuit rebus iisdem quibus fortasse nonnulli :

at valuit assiduitate, valuit observandis amieis, valuit liberalitate:
suit in oculis, petivit ; ea est usus ratione vitae, qua minima invidia
novi homines plurimi sunt eosdem honores consecuti.

XXVIII. Nam quod ais, Cassi, non plus me Plancio debere
quam bonis omnibus, quod iis aeque mea salus cara fuerit, ego me
debere bonis omnibus fateor; sed etiam ii, quibus ego debeo, boni
viri et cives, aediliciis comitiis aliquid se meo nomine debere

Plancio dicebant.

Verum fac me multis debere et in iis Plancio:

utrum igitur me conturbare oportet, an ceteris, quum cujusque dies
venerit, huic nomen quod urget nunc quum petitur dissolvere?

by the ‘populus' The ‘necessitas' to his
serving in Africa under Torquatus, and
under Metellus in Crete, “ea necessitate
adductus, qua omnes cogebantur post
sumptam togam virilem decem stipendia
facere'' (Ferratius, quoted by Wunder).
The explanation of ‘sorte' and ‘lege' is
certainly right. I am not sure if the ex-
planation of ‘necessitate ' is.

Non valuit] He was not an orator or a
‘jurisconsultus' (c. 25). But 116 had all
the other qualities of a successful candidate.
He knew his business.-—‘ observandis εἰ in
the edition of Naugerius. T. E. have ‘ad-
servandis,' and the rest have ‘ servandis!—
‘ petivit ea usus ratione :⁹ so Wunder has it,
omitting ‘est’ before ι115115,’ though he
says that the MSS. have ‘est.' He con-
tends that the ‘est' is' not genuine, for
‘petivit’ used thus barely is inept, since
Laterensis ⁴ petivit aedilitatem' as well as
Plancius. It is certain that Cicero is
speaking about the aedileship ; but is ‘pe-
tivit' standing alone more strange than
‘ fuit in oculis ?’ If we write ‘petivit ea
usus ratione vitae,' the word ¹ vitae ' seems
to spoil the sense, and so Wunder says in
his Prolegomena, that if we accept his read-
ing, ‘petivit ea usus,' it follows that we
must omit ‘ vitae—‚¹ for Cicero is not speak-
ing of Plancius’ ‘ratio vitae,' but of his
canvass for the aedileship. But in bis note
he finds good reason for retaining ‘ vitae.'
These discussions are endless. There. is
matter for the longest note on both sides of

the question, but no note will settle it.

Wunder also omits ‘ sunt,’ which in some
editions is placed after ‘consecuti,' and in
others after ¹ plurimi.’

28. mco nomine] ‘ On my account‚’ in
consideration of Planciu's' services to me in
my exile—⁴ conturbare? we must supply
‘ rationes,’ says Graevius. The word was also

used absolutely (Juv.xdi.129)‚ and signified
to act frauduleutly towards a creditor, or to-
wards an employer or master,notto pay what
was due. In Dig. 14. 3. 5, ξ 9, the word
⁴ conturbaverit ' expresses an act of embezzle-
ment 3 and in Dig. 15. 3. 16, the word ‘ con-
turbaverat ’ is applied to a person who did
not pay what he ought to have paid, and
who had acted fraudulently. In a passage
of Ulpian, Dig. ll. 3. 1, ξ 5, there is the
expression ⁴ ut rationem sibi commissam
turbaret‚' the exact meaning of which pas-
sage Ι (10 not know, but it expresses a
fraudulent act by a slave to whom his mas-
ter had entrusted some business.
quum cujusque dies venerit]
each man’s debt is due! This is a common
expression. The time for demand of pay-
ment is ‘ dies venit! Ulpian (Dig. 50. 16.
213) : ‘⁴ Cedere diem significat incipere
deberi pecuniam, venire diem significat,
eum diem venisse quo pecunia peti possit.'’
Cicero says, ‘Must I play the part of a
fraudulent debtor, or must Ι pay all the
rest of my creditors when the day of pay-
ment for each shall have come, and pay
Plancius (huic) a debt, which is pressing,
now when it is due ?’ ⁴ Huic' is Wunder’s
correction. He says that the MSS. have
‘ hoc.’ Ι think the correction must be ac-
cepted ; but I am not quite convinced that

‘ WVhen

it is necessary. It is however a correction ι

which does no harm, for it makes the sense
clear and satisfies the grammatical construc-
tion.

Wunder observes that the editors have
said nothing about the explanation. Hc
explains it right3 but it is hard to under-
stand how any body could miss the sense,
even with the reading ‘ hoc.' Yet the Ger-
man translator Wolff, whom he quotes, did
miss it.—‘ dissolvere ε’ see Index, Vol. iii..
‘ dissolvi.'
