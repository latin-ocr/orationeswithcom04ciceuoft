GAP. 10, 11. 53

vobis attente audientibus, propterea quod egomet tam triste illud
et tam asperum genus orationis horrebam. Ac prima pars fuit illa
quae me minus movebat, fuisse meo necessario Bestiae Caelium
familiarem, caenasse apud eum, ventitasse domum, studuisse prae-
turae. Non me haec movent quae perspicue falsa sunt. Etenim
eos una caenasse dixit, qui aut absunt aut quibus necesse est idem
dicere. Neque vero illud me commovet, quod sibi in Lupercis
sodalem esse Caelium dixit. Fera quaedam sodalitas et plane
pastoricia atque agrestis germanorum Lupercorum, quorum coitio
illa silvestris ante est instituta quam humanitas atque leges,
siquidem non modo nomina deferunt inter se sodales, sed etiam
commemorant sodalitatem in accusando, ut ne quis id forte nesciat

timere videantur.
moverunt respondeo.

Sed haec omittam: ad illa quae me magis

Deliciarum objurgatio fuit longa et ea lenior, plusque disputationis

Bestiae] L. Calpurnius Piso Bestia was
prosecuted for ‘ ambitus ' in his canvass for
the praetorship‚ B.c. 56. Cicero defended
him; but he was convicted (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 33
Phil. xi. 5).—⁴ studuisse praeturae ' means
that he helped himin the election for the
praetorship.

aut quibus necesse est] ‘Because they
are the friends of Clodia ' (Manutius).
Abrami proposes to read ‘aut de quibus,’
διο. Orelli following Ferratius thus ex-
plains the passage, ‘etenim eos una,’&c. : he
said that some others supped together with
Caelius at Bestia's house, and that these
are either persons who are absent (aut qui
absunt), which of itself shows the falsehood
of the charge, or persons who were com-
pelled by some necessity, such as debt or
the influence of Clodia, to say that they
supped at Bestia’s in company with Caelius.
This seems to be the meaning. He says
that those who said that they supped with
Caelius at Bestia’s are either not here to give
their testimony to the fact, or they are peoplc
who must say what they are told to say.

in Lupercis] The Lupercalia was a
festival celebrated in February in honour of
Pan Lycaeus (Phil. ii. :54 ; Plutarch, Romu-
lus, c. 21). Plutarch supposed it to be a
very antient festival, instituted by the Ar-
cadians of Evander; and virgil adopts the
tradition. Ovid (Fasti, v. 99) says :

‘⁴ Sacraque multa quidem, sed Fauni prima
bicornis
Has docuit gentes alipedisque dei.
Semicaper, coleris cinctutis, Faune, Lu-
percis,
Quum lustrant celebres vellera sectavitis?

The meaning is obscure. ‘ Dixit ’ seems to
refer to L. Herennius, who complained, as
Abrami conjectures, that Caelius had com-
menced a prosecution against him, though
they were ‘in Lupercis sodales,' members
of this honourable traternity. Cicero replies
that the Lupercalia was a rude festival,
and it is no wonder that ⁴ sodales ’ of such
a kind should not scruple to accuse one
another, and should even take care to lot
people know that they do accuse their
‘sodalesf Weiske conjectures that Heren-
nius charged Caelius with conducting him-
selfindecently at the Lupercalia, and that
he had seen it himself, being one of tho
⁴ sodales.’ Abrami observes that Cato (De
Sen. c. 13) speaks of‘ sodalitates ¹ being hrst
instituted when he was quaestor-3 hut the
¹ sodalitates ’ of which Cato speaks were of
a different kind (Vol. iii. index, sodales).—
‘germani Luperci’ are ⁴ genuine Luperci,’
men well worthy of the name. Cicero (Ad
Att. iv. 5) says ‘⁸ scio . . me asinum ger-
manum tuisse ;’' ‘I know that l have been
a genuine ass.'—‘ videantur ι’ llotmanu,
Abrami, and llaln1; ¹ videatur ' C.

Deliciarum objuryatio] The attack on
Caelius' loose way of living (deliciae) was
made at greater length, and ln gentler ternis
(lenior), and there was more of argumen-
tation in it than invective (atrocitas). As
the ‘judices’ had listened attentirely to
this scandat about Caclius, Cicero thought
it right to reply on that manen—⁸ P. cto-
diusz’ not his enemy Ρ, Clodius, if he really
means ‘amicus meus.' but another of tho
name, one ot' the ⁸ subscriptores ' os Atra-
tinus.
