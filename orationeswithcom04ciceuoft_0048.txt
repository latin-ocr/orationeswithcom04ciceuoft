26 ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

’ Quum tot hominum millia accumberent, quum ipse epuli dominus
Q. Arrius albatus esset, tu in templum Castoris te cum C. Fibulo
atrato ceterisque tuis furiis funestum intulisti. Quis tum non in-
gemuit, quis non doluit rei publicae casum? Qui sermo alius in illo
epulo fuit nisi hanc tantam et tam gravem civitatem subjectam esse
non modo furori, verum etiam irrisioni tuae? Hunc tu morem
ignorabas, numquam epulum videras, numquam puer aut adolescens
inter coquos fueras? Fausti, adolescentis nobilissimi, paullo ante
ex epulo magnificentissimo famem illam veterem tuam non expleras?
Quem accumbere atratum videras, dominum cum toga pulla et ejus
amicos ante convivium? quae te tanta tenuit amentia, ut nisi id
fecisses quod fas non suit, nisi violasses templum Castoris, nomen
epuli, oculos civium, morem veterem, ejus qui te invitarat auctori-
tatem, parum putares testificatum esse supplicationes te illas non
putare?

XIV. Quaero etiam illud ex te quod privatus admisisti—in quo

temple: they turned temples for the occa-
sion into eating-houses : the equites in the
nearest Forum3 and the common sort had
their tables set out in the streetS. It must .
have been a merry-making for all who were
invited3 and those who were not invited,
and we must assume that all were not asked,
how would they look on ?

Vatinius came ⁴ funestus‚’ in his mourn-
ing, in black, like an ill-bred fellow, who
accepts an invitation and makes himself
disagreeable.

coquos] οι· ⁴ cocos! It is not certain
what Cicero means by asking ‘ if he had not
perhaps been among the cooks ?' Some sup-
pose that Cicero alludes to the meanness of
Vatinius’ origin, as if he had been brought
up in the kitchen. Halm says the ⁴ coqui ’
are the ⁶ coqui funebres‚' who cooked for
the people on funeral occasions3 but I don’t
see that this explains the matter.

Fausti] Faustus Sulla had given a great
feast the year before, B.c. 60, in honour of
his illustrious father, the blood-stained dic-
tator (Pro Sulla, c. 19, note).

expleras] The reading is not certain.
There is ‘ expiaras,’ ⁴ expiares‚' and ⁴ expu-
leras‚' says Halm (ed. 1845). As to the
sense, it may not matter much whether we
take ‘ expiaras ' or ⁴ expleras.’ There seems
little point in Cicero asking ‘if Vatinius
had not satisfied his ravenous appetite at
Sulla’s feast.' Perhaps he means. he had
stuffed himself so well there that he might
have stayed away from this, if he could not
come in a proper dress like other people.

dominum . . ante convivium] Madvig
would erase these words, but that is a
desperate remedy¹ Why should not the
friends be mentioned as well as the ‘ domi-
nus ?’ It is true that ⁸ atratum ' and ‘ do-
minum' go together; but Cicero adds ⁴ et
ejus amicos,' that is ‘ atratos.’ ‘ Ante con-
vivium ’ is explained by Manutius to mean
‘ante oculos epulantis populi Romani 3'
for ‘ convivium’.can mean this. Halm
suggests that the dominus and his friends
had their table so placed that it could be
seen by the other guests3 by some of them,
for if they were in a temple they could not
be seen by all. However, the doors would
no doubt be open, and so they might be
considered to be eating in public.

quae te tanta] ‘Quae tanta te,’ Baiter,
followed by Halm, which is no improve-
ment. ‘Te' om. P. G.—‘ nomen epuli :¹
an ‘ epulum ’ signified joy. Isthen Vatinius
came in a mourning dress, he spoiled the
name of the thing. This is the explanation
of Goveanus, and the true explanation, as
Halm says.

14. privatus admisisti] ‘What you did
after you went out of office‚’ after you
ceased to be atribune. During his tribunate
(uc. 59) Vatinius might allege that he
acted with the ‘ vir clarissimus‚' with Caesar.
But in B.c. 58 Vatinius was out of office,
and the ‘vir clarissimus' was in Gallia.—
‘ Licinia et Junia:’ see Pro Sestio, c. 14,
note. The Scholiast, under the lemma
‘ Postulatusne sis lege Licinia‚’ says ‘¹ Cri-
mine de sodaliciis Vatinius coeperat accusari,
