324 ORAT. PRO T. ANNIO MILONE

Manet autem illa quoque excepta ejus oratio. Scripsit vero hanc
quam legimus, ita perfecte ut jure prima haberi possit.

 

Ι. Etsi vereor, judices, ne turpe sit pro fortissimo viro dicere
incipientem timere, minimeque deceat, quum T. Annius ipse magis
de rei publicae salute quam de sua perturbetur, me ad ejus caussam
parem animi magnitudinem afferre non posse, tamen haec novi
judicii nova forma terret oculos, qui quocumque inciderunt veterem
consuetudinem fori et pristinum mor em judiciorum requirunt. Non
enim corona consessus vester cinctus est ut solebat3 non usitata
frequentia stipati sumus, non illa praesidia, quae pro templis
omnibus cernitiS, etsi contra vim collocata sunt, non afferunt
tamen oratori aliquid, ut in foro et in judicic, quamquam prae-
sidiis salutaribus et necessariis septi sumus, tamen ne non timere
quidem sine aliquo timore possimus. Quae si opposita Miloni
putarem, cederem tempori, judices, nec inter tantam vim armorum
existimarem esse oratori locum. Sed me recreat et reficit Gn.
Pompeii sapientissimi et justissimi viri consilium, qui profecto nec
justitiae suae putaret esse, quem reum sententiis judicum tradi-
disset, eundem telis militum dedere, nec sapientiae, temeritatem
concitatae multitudinis auctoritate publica armare. Quamobrem
illa arma, centuriones, cohortes non periculum nobis, sed prae-
sidium denuntiant, neque solum ut quieto sed etiam ut magno
animo simus hortantur, neque auxilium modo defensioni meae,
Cassius (40, c. 54) is that Cicero failed in
his defence, and through sear could not say
what he had prepared. He said a little in
a lifeless manner, and was glad to withdraw.

Plutarch (Cicero, c. 35) says nearly the
same. Dion says that Cicero wrote the

seated. Cicero, Ad Att.. i. 16: “Non enim
unquam turpior in ludo talario consessus
fuit :'’ where he is speaking of the ‘ judices’
who tried Clodius for the affair of the
Bona Dea.

speech which we now have, and sent a copy
of it to Milo in his exile at Massilia. As-
conius remarks that the speech which he
actually did deliver was taken down by the
short-hand writers, and was extant. A
comparison of the two speeches would be
very instructive. That which remains is
one of Cicero’s best compositions. If his
defence is not ve'ry good, the fault was in
the case, for it was not defensible.

l. Etsi vereor . . solebat] This is
quoted by Quintilian (xi. 3, 47—50)‚ who
has several remarks on it in this chapter,
which is on Pronuntiatio (see c. 38, and note
on Pronuntiatio).

note.

The two negations do not negative one
another, as Halm correctly remarks. The
form of expression is not adapted to our
language, and the whole sentence is a good
exercise for translation. Cicero says, that
the soldiers who are posted there to pre-
vent violence, still do some violence to the
orator, and so he cannot without some
sear even be relieved from sear. It is a
labomed, artificial way of talking, or rather
of wrsting, for men do not speak in this
way.

tempori] ‘temporibus’ T. Wunder
thinks that the word should be erased.
Cicero has the same form Ad Div. ii. 9,
and explains it “tempori cedere, id est
necessitati parere, semper sapientis est.''
(Halm.)—‘oratori:’ E. has ‘cl-ationi,’
which Halm has injudiciously preferred.
