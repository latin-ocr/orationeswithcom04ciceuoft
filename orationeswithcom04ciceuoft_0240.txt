218 PRO GN. PLANCIO.

ground for punishing the briber is this : by presenting to an elector the
temptation of money, he may get a vote which might have been given to
another candidate, if he had not tempted the elector3 and thus being
guilty of corrupting a political institution, supposed to be an institution
useful to the state, he is justly punished with the penalty of the law
and the contempt of honest men. The elector is a dishonest man
too, if he receives a bribe, and he is justly liable to punishment for cor-
rupting a politica] institution. But if he is punished for taking a bribe,
he will be as careful to conceal the fact as the giver of the bribe is. If hc ,
15 not punished, he will take the money with all gladness ofheart, he will
care nothing about the'risk of the briber, and he will be ready to give evi-
dence against him. It may be suggested that if an elector is not punished
for taking a bribe, men might be found vile enough to charge an inno-
cent candidate with bribing them or others. This is possible; but it is
enough for the present to reply that an attempt to prove as a fact what
never was a fact, is rather more difficult than to give sufficient evidence
about a real fact. The law of England punishes both the briber and the
bribed, and so makes the proof of bribery more difficult².

The passage in the Pro Murena (c. 23, and the note), which contains
the words “ Morbi excusationi poena addita est,’' has been understood
in various ways. Ferratius maintains that these words mean that the
trial should not, as it was before the enactment of the Lex Tullia, be
deferred or adjourned on the ground of the accused falling sick, but

2 The last Act 17 and 18 Vict. 0. 102 (1854) is “ An Act to consolidate and amend the
Laws relating to Bribery, Treating, and undue Influence at Elections of Members of Par-
liament.’' It repeals either entirely or partially ten Acts about bribery and corruption.
It defines bribery both with respect to the briber and the bribed. The briber is declared
to be guilty of a misdemeanour, and is also liable to forfeit one hundred pounds to any
person who shall sue for the same together with full costs of suit. The bribed is also
declared to be guilty of misdemeanmr, and is also liable to forfeit ten pounds to any
person &c. There 15 0 clause against treating and one against what is called undue in-
fluence. One effect of a conviction for bribery at Rome was the loss of the office which
the candidate had got ; and he went into exile. It seems probable that he could not
reside any where in Italy, which to a Roman was a great punishment. A member of the
House of Commons may be deprived of his seat by the judgment of an election committee,
which is a certain number of members of the House who are appointed to try disputed
elections. “ If any candidate at any election for any county, city, or borough shall be
declared by any election committee guilty, by himself or his agents, of bribery‚ treating,
or undue influence at such electiori, such candidate shall be incapable of being elected or
sitting in Parliament for such county, city, or borough during the Parliament then 111
existence.'⁷ It is not easy to read with gravity this terrible penalty, which in fact is an
act of kindncss to the simpleton who has drained his pockets once. He is not allowed to
do it again “during the Parliament then in existence.’' The whole Act is a farce with
its definitions and its penalties. Anybody may sue for the penalties3 but where does
the legislature expect to find a man fool enough to do it? If the House of Commoris would
allow somebody else to make a Bribery Act for them, it would be a very different thing.
