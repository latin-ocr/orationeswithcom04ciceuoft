456 INTRODUCTION

Brutus and Cassius, who were praetors in nc. 44, were to have respec-
tively Macedonia and Syria during the next year. Decimus Brutus had
Gallia Cisalpina, and O. Trebonius Asia3 and both of them had left
Rome for their provinces. Brutus and Cassius could not go to their
provinces, being detained at Rome by their office. They had kept
in retirement since the memorable day of Caesar’s funeral, and in the
month of April they left Rome, where they had no power and were not
safe. They stayed somewhere in the neighbourhood, and Antonius took
care that they should not return. He got a Lex passed by which the
Praetor Urbanus was released from his obligation not to be absent from
Rome for more than ten days3 and on the motion of Antonius also, M.
Brutus received a commission to look after supplies of corn from Creta,
and Cassius from Cyrene. They were to have these provinces as pro-
consuls in place of those which were assigned to them before (Phil. xi.
12). Dolabella had secured for himself Syria, as it has been already
said, and he was to conduct the war against the Parthians. Antonius
obtained from the senate Macedonia, where the legions were stationed
which Caesar had got ready for the Parthian war. But he soon wished
to exchange Macedonia for Decimus Brutus’ province of Gallia Cisal-
pina, and to remove thither the legions from Macedonia. This was too
barefaced a proposal for the senate to entertain 3 but Antonius got the
people to consent to this new arrangement, which may have been made
in June, for in J uly the Macedonian legions were expected at Bruu-
disium (Ad Att. xvi. 5 and 4). Brutus’ refusal to give up Gallia Cis-
alpina was afterwards the cause of the war in north Italy.

The great conspirators M. Brutus and Cassius began and ended their
work of liberation on the l5th of March by an act of assassination.
They did nothing after that day, and perhaps they could not, for they
had killed a usurper without well considering what was to come next.
We do not know well what they were doing after the 18th of March.
There is a letter from M. Brutus and Cassius to Antonius (Ad Div. xi.
2), which was written after Dolabella had destroyed the altar, and after
Antonius’ return to Rome. They tell Antonius that they are informed
by letter that a great number of old soldiers (veterani) had flooked to
Rome, and that many more were expected on the lst of June, the day
which Antonius had fixed for a meeting of the senate to deliberate about
Caesar’s Acta (Phil. ii. c. 39). They ask Antonius if he thinks that they
will be safe at Rome among so many soldiers. They were probably never
in Rome after the date of this letter. Brutus lingered in Italy till the
Ludi Apollinares were celebrated (7 th of J uly), which it was his busi-
ness as Praetor Urbanus to provide for. The Praetor C. Antonius in
Brutus’ absence superintended the games, and Brutus furnished the
eost. He had hired actors, he had bought many wild beasts, and spared
