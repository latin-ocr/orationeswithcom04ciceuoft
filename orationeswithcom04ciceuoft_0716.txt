INTRODUOTION TO THE FOURTEENTH PHILIPPIG.

Tms speech was delivered on the 2lst of ΑΡΓΠμξ-ςύᾴὸ, on the occasion
of the news which had arrived the day before of the fights in Gallia
Cisalpina between M. Antonius and the forces of the senate (c. 5, 6, and
the notes). A letter from Ser. Galba to Cicero (Ad Div. x. 30> tells
what took place 011 the day of the battle3 but Appian's narrative is
much better (B. G. iii. 66—70).

When Pansa was advancing to Mutina, Caesar and Hirtius sent Car-
suleius to meet him, with the Praetoriae cohortes of Caesar and the
Legio Martia, in order to protect him in his march through the mountain
passes, which Antonius had intentionally neglected to occupy. Antonius
not being able to make much use of his cavalry, because the plain country
was marshy and intersected by ditches, placed his two best legions on
each side of the narrow causeway, where they were covered by the reeds.
This causeway was the Via Aemilia, which ran in a straight line from
Ariminum through Bononia and Forum Gallorum to qutina. Carsuleius
and Pansa got through the passes in the night, and at daybreak the Martia
and five other cohorts came on the Via Aemilia, along which they marched
without seeing any enemy,but keeping a look out on the marsh on each side.
The stirring of the reeds soon gave them the alarm‚ and the flash of a hel-
met and a shield was seen here and there3 and all at once the Praetoriae
cohortes of Antonius appeared in front. The soldiers of the Martia
thus being hemmed in on all sides, aud having no chance of escape, called
out that the newly-levied troops (Tirones), when they should come up,
should not join them, for they feared that their want of experience
might throw the Martia into confusion. The Praetoriae of Caesar were
opposed to the Praetoriae of Antonius3 and the Martia forming two
divisions entered the marsh on each side of the road, each division being
commanded respectively by Pansa and Carsuleius. Thus there were
two fights, and the combatants on one side os the road could not see
what was done on the other side. The Praetoriae were engaged in a
third fight on the road itself.

The battle was fought with great obstinacy‚ at close quarters3 for the
marshes and the ditch did not permit any movements of the troops. It
was a fight hand to hand with the sword, and every blow· brought death.
When one man fell he was carried off, and another took his place. The

Tirones came up during the fight, and saw with amazement this terrible
contest carried on in perfect order and silence.
