CAP. 38—40. 521

tasti3 An eas, ad quas te peragratis veteranorum coloniis stipa-
tum armis rettulisti?

O praeclaram illam percursat-ionem tuam mense Aprili atque
Maio, tum quum etiam Capuam coloniam deducere conatus es.
Quemadmodum illinc abieris, vel potius paene non abieris, scimus.
Oui tu urbi minitaris. Utinam conere, ut aliquando illud ‘ paene'
tollatur! At quam nobilis est tua illa peregrinatio. Quid pran-
diorum apparatus, quid furiosam vinolentiam tuam proferam? Tua
ista detrimenta sunt3 illa nostra. Agrum Campanum, qui quum
de vectigalibus eximebatur ut militibus daretur, tamen infligi mag-
num rei publicae vulnus putabamus, hunc tu compransoribus tuis et
collusoribus dividebas. Mimos dico et mimas, patres conscripti, in
agro Campano collocatos. Quid jam querar de agro Leontino?
quoniam quidem hae quondam arationes Campana et Leontina in
populi Romani patrimonio grandiferae et fructuosae ferebantur.
Medico tria millia jugerum, quasi te sanum fecisset3 rhetori duo,
quasi disertum facere potuisset. Sed ad iter Italiamque redeamus.
XL. Deduxisti coloniam Casilinum, quo Caesar ante deduxerat.
consuluisti me per litteras de Capua tu quidem, sed idem de Casi-
lino respondissem, possesne ubi colonia esset eo coloniam novam
jure deducere. Negavi in eam coloniam quae esset auspicato de-
ducta, dum esset incolumis, coloniam novam jure deduei; colonos

Aprili] See the Introd.—‘ paene non
abieris:’ he means to say that he hardly
escaped with his life, for the settlers were
not willing to receive new settlers among
them, who must be provided with land in
some way, and by some being taken from
the old settlers‚ if none was lest unassigned.
Compare Phil. viii. c. 8 and 9, where Cicero
speaks of assignments having been made by
Antonius and Dolabella in the Campanus
a er.

gilla nostra] The things which he is
going to mention. So ‘illud ’ is often used.
This Ager Campanus had been given to
veteran soldiers by a Lex ,Iulia 13.c. 59
(Sueton. Julius, c. 20).

Leontinus ayer] Sec e. 34. There were
great ‘ arationes‚' tracts of arable land, in the
Ager Leontinus, which were sarmed by Ro-
man citizens and others. Cicero (Verr. ii.
3, c. 51) speaks of the Leontinus ager being
divided among eighty-four tenants when
Verres arrived in Sicily. “The Leontine
territory of about 30‚000 jugera of arable
land, which as Roman domuin was leased
by the Censors, we find some time after
divided among not more than eighty-four

lessees‚ who consequently had on an average
360 jugera apiece; and among the lessecs
only one was a Leontine‚ the rest were stran-
gers to the territory, mostly Roman specu-
lators ’' (Th. Mommsen, Romische Ge-
schichte, ii. 71).

grandiferae] V, g, Halm. The common
reading is ¹ grandi fenorc.’ Martianus Ca-
pella (v. ξ 511), quoted by Halm, has
“His plerumque grammatice utitur, licet
Tullius yramliferas possessiones dieat et
yrandiloquos oratores.''—‘ rhetori? see c.
17: Antonius had a royal mind in every
thing. lle paid his tcacher and his doctor
out of the public money, and paid them
welk—⁶ quasi te,' &c. : ⁴ quid, si te sanasset
. . . quid, si te disertum,' Halm.

40. Casilinum] On the site of the. pre-
sent Capoua in Campania, on the Vulturnus,
a few miles west of Capua. Caesar had
planted some of his veterans here, whom
Octavianus indue-ed to join 111111, when he
was making head against Antonius (Appiam.
B. C. iii. 40, and the Introd. to the Third
Philippic).—‘tu quidem :¹ ‘it is truc that
you asked my opinion.' So ⁴ ille (pridem '
often occurs.
