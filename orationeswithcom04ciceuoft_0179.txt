INTRODUCTION. 157

opinions, this oration is the evidence of a mean anditimid character, for
which we might indeed find some apology3 but for* the loathsome flat-
tery, for the base servility to a man who had done Cicero wrong, which
he never forgot or forgave, for such adulation and hypocrisy there is no
excuse. Cicero, with the help of his own letters, presents himself to
posterity, whose applause was the thing that he called immortality (Ad
Fam. v. 12), as a man humiliated, degraded, and sels-disgraced.

In this speech, which is a panegyric on Caesar, Cicero while he exalted
the son-in-law did not spare the father-in-law. Caesar, who looked
sharp after his own interests, was satisfied if he got what he wanted, and
he did not resent Cicero's attack on Piso, which was the cause of Piso’s
recall. But the governor of Macedonia did not remain quiet under the
imputations which Cicero had brought against him, and he addressed
the senate. Cicero replied (In Pisonem) in this speech, which for foul
abuse has seldom been equalled. If Piso was as bad as Cicero says he
was, he was not worthy of any answer except a notice of prosecution ;
and the wonder is that the Senate could listen to such tedious ribaldry.
But there was perfect freedom of speech in the Roman senate: men said
just what they liked, and it was the fashion for the rest to listen.
Though many of the charges against Piso are vaguely made, we must
admit that Piso’s character was bad, and that he had misgovernecl
his province, for if there had not been a reasonable foundation for Ci-
cero's abuse, such a speech would have been his complete ruin. Cicero's
character is lowered by what he says against his enemy, by the way in
which he says it, and by the unworthy arts which he practised to learn
the private life and habits of Piso. There is no dignity 111 the speech,
but plenty of invective, prompted by hatred and revenge, and expressed
in terms of coarse abuse and gross exaggeration.

Markland supposed that this oration and the oration Pro P. Sestio
were much used by the author of the four spurious orations (Vol. iii.
299). Some references in those four orations and in the notes to the
Pro Sestio and those to this oration will direct the render to a com-
parison of passages, and will show him that Cicero, even when he is most
coarse and abusive, did not write like the impudent linave who set
Cicero's name to his own clumsy patchwork.

The first part of this oration is defective, as the beginning shows, and
the fragments collected from various writers which are not found in tlw
extant speech. It is edited by Halm in the second edition of Orelli's
Cicero. The following are the abbreviations of the MSS. which Halm
refers to 2—-

A = lemmata Q. Asconii Pediani.

T = fragmenta palimpsesti Taurinensis a Peyronio collati.
