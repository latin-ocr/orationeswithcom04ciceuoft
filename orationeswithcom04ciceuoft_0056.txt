PRO M. CAELIO

ORATIO.

INTRODUOTION.

M. CAELiUs RUFUS, the son of M. Caelius Rufus a Roman Eques, was
born B.c. 82. When he was a youth, his father introduced him to M.
Crassus and to M. Cicero, that he might have the opportunity of im-
proving his oratorical talents and getting some knowledge of public
affairs by seeing and conversing with those distinguished men. Cicero
(Brutus, c. 79> bears testimony to the oratorical talent of his young
friend, whose career terminated at an early age (Bc. 48), and long
before the time when a man’s abilities attain their maturity. Quintilian
(x. 1, 115) says, “Caelius had great ability and particularly great ur-
banity (urbanitas) as a prosecutor, and was worthy of a better dispo-
sition and a longer life.'’ In the collection of Cicero’s Letters (Ad
Fam. lib. viii.) there is a book of letters from Caelius to Cicero, seven-
teen letters in all, which are very well written. Catullus, who was a
friend of Caelius, has addressed two of his short poems to him (58 and
100). We learn enough of Caelius' character from Cicero’s admissions
in this oration. He was a young man of strong passions, and had lived
an irregular life3 but Cicero assures the judices that he had amended
and would still improve. His amours with Clodia first gave him a bad
name and then a quarrel with the woman got him into trouble3 but he
was well rid of such a woman at the cost of having to defend himself
against the charges which she instigated others to make.

Caelius began his career as an orator in Rc. 59 by prosecuting C.
Antonius, Cicero’s colleague in the consulship. The year of his quaes-
torship is uncertain, but it was before this oration was delivered, as we
may infer from a passage (c. 7), in which Cicero says that Caelius had
not been guilty of bribery (ambitus), for at that time he certainly
could have held no office except the quaestorship. He next prosecuted
