cAP. 15, 16. 31

G. Alfium praeteritum permoleste tulisse, quod in homine summam
fidem probitatemque cognosset, graviterque etiam se ferre prae-
torem aliquem esse factum qui a suis rationibus dissensisset3 tum
¹ quaesisse quendam, de Vatinio quemadmodum ferret, ipsum re-
spondisse, Vatinium in tribunatu gratis nihil fecisse: qui omnia in
pecunia posuisset, honore animo aequo carere debere. Quod si
ipse, qui te suae dignitatis augendae caussa, periculo tuo, nullo suo
delicto, ferri praecipitem est facile passus, tamen te omni honore
indignissimum judicat; si te vicini, si affines, si tribules ita oderunt.
ut repulsam tuam triumphum suum duxerint, si nemo aspicit quin
ingemiscat, nemo ment-ionem facit quin exsecretur3 si vitant,
fugiunt, audire de te nolunt, quum viderunt, tamquam auspicium
malum detestantur; si cognati respuunt, tribules exsecrantur,
vicini metuunt, affines erubescunt, strumae denique ab ore improbo
demigrarunt, et aliis jam se locis collocarunt, si es odium publicum
populi, senatus, universorum hominum rusticanorum3 quid est
quam ob rem praeturam potius exoptes quam mortem? praesertim

very precise term. Caesar was at Aquileia
in the early part of B.c. 58 (B. G. i. lu).
He was in Gallia Citerior at the end of ac.
58, and at the beginning of B.c. 57 (B. G.
ii. l); and he was in North Italy again at
the end of B.c. 57 or in the beginning of
13.c. 56. In the winter of 57-56 he went
into Illyricum (B. G. iii. 7), and on his road
he would pass through Aquileia. It is to
the early part of B.c. 56 that Cicero seems
to refer.—‘ C. Alfium:’ he was a trib. pl.
who supported Caesar against- his colleague
Bibulus. He was ¹ praeteritus‚’ rejected at
the election, when he was a candidate for
the praetorship. But he was afterwards
elected (Ad Q. Fr. iii. 1 ; and Pro Sestio, c.
53). The ‘ praetorem aliquem ’ is Cn.
Domitius Calvinus, as the Scholiast says.
Halm suggests that Q. Ancharius also is
alluded to. ,

nullo suo delicto] And yet Caesar ¹ suae
dignitatis augendae caussa . . . ferri praecipi-
tem est facile passus.' Cicero spares the
man whom hc feared, and pours out all his
abuse on caesai-'s tool.

vicini metuunt] T'ne ‘tribules ' and
‘ vicini ’ are mentioned separately. Hermann
supposes the ‘ vicini ’ to be the Sabini, for
Vatinius was a Reatinus (Cic. De Nat.. Deor.
ii. c. 2), and we may assume that his patri-
monial property was in that country. If
Vatinius belonged to the tribus Sergia, and
the Sabini to the Quirina or Velia, the
Sabini are properly distinguished as ⁴ vicini’

from Vatinius’ ‘tribules’ the Marsi and
Peligni (c. 15). Aman retained the ‘tribus'
to which his ancestors belonged, even if he
had his domicile in another district. The
Sabini, his vicini, feared Vatinius, because
being a powerful man he could plague them,
if any dispute at any time arose between
him and his neighbours about the boun-
daries of their property (Hermann). There
might be no disputes about boundaries (de
finibus regundis), and yet Vatinius might be
a bad neiglibour and plague the people in
many ways.

strumae . . . collocarunt] These per-
sonal allusions of Cicero are disgraeeful to
him, and the joke, whatever it means, is
frigid and iusipid. Schiitz thought the
passage might be interpohsted, because
Cicero (c. 2) describes Vatinius as ⁴ inflato
collo.' But there is nothing in this remark.

odium publicum populi] ‘ Populi ’ seems
unnecessary after ⁴publioum‚' but it is in
the MSS. Horace has ⁸ publica cum'
(carm. ii. 8. 7) ε

“juvenumque prodis
Publica cura.’'

Cicero ends with telling the mun that as ho
wishes to be popular. the best way to get
his wish is to die. Passeratius reminds ns
of a like point in the Minui of P. Syrus (v.
23): “Avarus nisi quum moritur nihil recte
facit.''
