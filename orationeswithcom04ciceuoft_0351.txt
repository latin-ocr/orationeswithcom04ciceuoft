mortuae contiones, quibus quotidie meam potentiam invidiose cri-
minabatur, quum diceret senatum non quod sentiret, sed quod ego
vellem decernere. Quae quidem si potentia est appellanda potius
quam aut propter magna in rem publicam merita mediocris in bonis
caussis auctoritas, aut propter hos officiosos labores meos nonnulla
apud bonos gratia, appelletur ita sane, dummodo ea nos utamur
pro salute bonorum contra amentiam perditorum. Hanc vero
quaestionem, etsi non est iniqua, numquam tamen senatus consti-
tuendam putavit; erant enim leges, erant quaestiones vel de
caede vel de vi, nec tantum maerorem ac luctum senatui mors P.
Clodii afferebat ut nova quaestio constitueretur. Cujus enim de
illo incesto stupro judicium decernendi senatui potestas esset
erepta, de ejus interitu quis potest credere senatum judicium
novum constituendum putasse? Cur igitur incendium curiae, op-
pugnationem aedium M. Lepidi, caedem hanc ipsam contra rem

Asconius explains this: ‘⁴ T. Munatius i. 13 and 14). But when the Rogatio, in

Cicero then means that the speech was
stopped, stifled by the flames.

observes that ‘ aut . . . aut' in this passage
do not denote an exclusive oppositi0n‚ and
that consequently ⁴ vel . . . vel' would do
as well.

erant enim loyes] There was no occa-
sion t'or the senate to establish a new kind
of trial: there were Leges and forms of
trial already adapted to such cases, the
Lex Cornelia, and the Plautia De vi.

Cujus enim (le illo incesto] This is the
old story of Clodius having got into Caesar's
house to have an intrigue with Caesar's
wife, as it was said, at the time when the
ceremonies of the Bona Dea were going
on, at which no male was allowed to be
present (8.0. 62). It was first proposed in
the senate by the consuls M. Pupius Piso
and M. Messala, that a particular form of
trial (nova quaestio) should be established
for Clodius' otl'ence against religion, for
there was no ‘perpetua quaestio' which ap-
plied to Clodius’ case; and that the ⁴ judices '

conformity to the decis-ion of the senate,
was proposed to the people, Clodius* faction
and the bad saith of the consul Piso pre-
vented the question being put to the vote.
At last the tribune Fufius proposed a
Lex, which differed only from the con-
sular Rogatio in the way of ehoosing the
‘judices,’ but, as Cicero remarks (Ad Att.
i. 16), this was everything. Clodius was
tried and acquitted by a small majority of
the ‘judices,’ and his acquittal, as Cicero
sayS, was the result of bribery. This ex-
plains what Cicero says here, ‘judicium
decernendi senatui potestas esset e1·epta.'

The term ‘incestus' comprehende-d all
acts that offend against morality and reli-
gi0n3 such acts, for instance, as the un-
chastity of a Vestal. The Pontifices who
were consulted in the matter of Clodius
reported that it was ⁴ nefas.'

M. Lepidi] See the Introduction. As-
conius tells all the story about Lepidus:
“Post biduum medium quam Clodius oc-
cisus erat, interrex primus proditus est
Μ. Aemilius Lepidus. Non fuit autem
moris ab eo, qui primus interrex proditus
erat, comitia haberi. Sed Scipionis et
Hypsaei factiones, quia recens invidia Mi-
lonis erat, cum contra jus postularent ut
interrex ad comitia consulum creandorum
descenderet, idque ipse non faceret, domum
ejus per omnes interregni dies (sum-unt
autem ex morequiuque)obsederunt. Deinde
