532 INTRODUCTION

that Caesar would gain over the soldiers, set out on the eth of Oc-
tober with his wife Fulvia to Brundisium, to meet the four legions from
Macedonia, which the senate had given him, the Martia, the Secunda,
the Quarta, and the Trigesima Quinta. About the same time Caesar
set out to Campania, to raise troops among the veterans whom the Dic-
tator had planted in those parts (Appian, B. C. iii. c. 40). He was
afraid that Antonius on his return fiom Brundisium would crush him,
if he were not able to protect himself.

At Suessa Auruncorum Antonius put some soldiers to death, probably
because he discovered them to be active on the part of Caesar (Phil. xiii.
c. 83 iii. c. 4). He found the soldiers at Brundisium ill-disposed to-
wards him. He threatened them for not bringing before him those who
had been sent by the petulant youth, meaning Caesar, to corrupt the
troops, and he said that he would find them out himself: he said that he
would lead them to his province Gallia, and would give to all who were
there one hundred denarii each. The soldiers laughed at the smallness
of his present, for Caesar promised more, and, as Antonius grew angry,
they began to leave him. Upon this Antonius ordered the tribunes to
hand over to him the mutineers, for the tribunes knew every soldier’ s
character, it being the plactice to mark each man’ s character in the
muster rolls. He ζ’10011 every tenth man by lot, but he did not put them
all to death, though he might have done it according to the rules of war,
for the army was in a state of mutiny (Appian, B. C.' 1ii. c. 43, 443
Phil. iii. c. 123 v. c. 8). This punishment however did not restore
obedience: the soldiers were more irritated than terrified.

Antonius, hearing of what Caesar was doing, changed the tribunes,
treated the soldiers more gently and sent them along the east coast in
divisions towards Ariminum. H aving strengthened his praetorian cohort
by selecting the most trustworthy men, he set out sor Rome. Caesar
informed Cicero on the lst of November that Antonius was advancing
on Rome with the legion of the Alaudae. He asked Cicero’s advice
whether he should go to Rome with three thousand veterans, or occupy
Capua and keep Antonius out of it, or go to the three Macedonian
legions, which were marching northwards along the east coast of Italy,
for he hoped that these three legions were in his favour. Cicero advised
Caesar to go to Rome (Ad Att. xvi. 8). This legion of the Alaudae
had been raised by the Dictator in Transalpine Gallia, and was not one
of the Macedonian legions It does not appear whether Antonius took
it with him to Brundisium or found it 011 the road as he went or re-
turned. Antonius was expected to reach Casilinum near Capua on the
‘7th of November, and Cicero got out of his way by moving towards
Arpinum (Ad Att. xvi. 10). It is not easy to follow clearly all Anto-
nius’ movements. He seems to have left the greater part of his meu at
