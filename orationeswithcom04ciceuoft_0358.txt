Servos] The epithet ‘barbari,’ says the termination of a branch of the Alban

Halm, merely denotes the character of these
slaves, not their occupation or origin. This
may be so, but Italy was now filled with
slaves from foreign countries. The 4 public
forests’ were the property of the State, Ι
suppose, or of towns. Fuel would be cut
here, and pitch made, and cattle pastured
there. 44 Nam quum in silva Sila facta
caedes esset notique homines interfecti in-
simulareturque familia, partim etiam liberti
societatis ejus quae picarias de P. Cornelio
L. Mummio censoribus redemisset'’ (Bru-
tus, c. 22). Clodius brought down the
rough fellows from the Apennines.

Favonio] 4 M. Favoni0‚' Baiter, as
Krause proposes to write his name (Frag.
Vet. Hist. Rom. p. 233).

10. ante diem] See in Cat. i. 3 and
the note. “ That this was not the twentieth
of Jannary, as several persons have as-
sumed, but the eighteenth of the same
mouth, has been proved by Brewer‚ Ueber
die Chronologie of this speech, xxviii„
whom the reader may consult on this mat-
ter” (Klotz). But it is not possible for
readers to go and consult every modern
book which a commentator refers to. I do
not know whether Klotz means that 4 ante
diem X111.’ is wrongly explained, or that Ci-
cero has named the wrong day. If he means
that the expression is wrongly explained, the
render need not trouble himself any further.

Lanuvium] Lanuvium, now Civita La-
vigna, was an old Latin ‘town on the right
of the Via Appia, as you go from Rome, at

hills, which projects some distance into the
level country, and in consequence of this
position it commands a clear view all round.
Lanuvium was connected by a road with
the Appia (Westphal‚ Romische Kam-
pagne). When the Lanuvini received the
Civitas after the dissolution of the Latin
league, Rc. 336, their sacred places were
restored to them. “ Lanuvinis civitas data,
sacraque sua reddita, ut aedes lucusque
Sospitae Junonis communis Lanuvinis mu-
nicipibus cum populo Romano esset'' (Livy,
viii. 14). Milo was going to assist at the
election of a priest of JunO. 4 Prodere' was
a word used by the Romans in the matter
of the appointment of an Interrex (Index,
Vol. iii.). Dictator was the title of the
chief magistrate of a Latin town, who was
annually elected. Klotz. following Abrami,
refers to Spartianus, Hadrian. c. 19: 44 Per
Latina oppida dictator et aedilis et duumvir
fuit.'’ The words ‘quod . . Milo' are
supposed by Bake to be from the hand of
a scholiast‚ which is probable, and it is
some evidence of an interpolation that
Cicero would have said ‘ quod esset.'
fundum] His estate. “Ager cum aedi-
ficio fundus dicitur'' (Dig. 50. 16. 211).
(Halm.)—‘ quae . . habita estt' Bake
thinks that this too is scholiast work.

Milo autem . . commoratus est] Quin-
tilian (iv. 2, 57) quotes these wordS‚ aud
he commends Cicero's art: “Quam nihil
praeparato, nihil festinato fecisse videtur
Milo. Quod non solum rebus ipsis vir
