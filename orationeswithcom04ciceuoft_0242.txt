220 PRO GN. PLANCIO.

by the consul Crassus, and enacted. Dion Cassius (39, c. 37) is said
to be the only ancient authority that speaks of enactments against Am-

bitus being made in the year Bc. 55, and though his language is not
clear, we know of no other Lex to which he can refer.

111 the year Bc. 56 the Senate had made a Consultum to this effect:
‘⁶ ut sodalitates decuriatique discederent, lexque de iis ferretur, ut qui

non discessissent ea poena quae est de vi tenerentur” (Cicero, Ad Q.
Fr. ii. 3, 5; Pro Plancio, cc. 15, 16, 17, 18). 117 is generally assumed
that in conformity with this Senatusconsultum the Lex called Licinia⁵
was enacted (Cicero, Ad Div. viii. 2), which was directed against asso-
ciations made for the purpose of elections. But the terms of the
Senatusconsultum apply to clubs or associations generally which had a
political character, and to the danger from such meetings3 and accord-
ingly the Senatusconsultum‚ which was in the nature of a declara-
tory act, declared that such assemblages of people should be con-
sidered as offences against the Leges de Vi. Rein is one of the
modern critics who has formed a correct conclusion from this passage of
Cicero.

The title of the Lex which was proposed by M. Licinius Crassus was
Licinia de Sodaliciis, as we learn from this oration. ‘Sodales’ was a
general term which signified members of a Sodalitas, a club or an asso-
ciation, such as we often read of in Roman history (Q. Cicero, De Petit.
Cons. c. 5); and the word Sodalitium or Sodalicium had the same
meaning. The expression ⁴ collegia sodalicia ’ occurs in the Digest (47.
22. 1, de Coll.), though some editions omit the word ‘ sodalicia ’ (Savigny,
System, Soc„ ii. p. 255, note). The Lex of Licinius then was directed
against clubs or associations, which, whatever might be their original
object, could easily be turned to the purposes of elections, and we must
proceed from this general notion to determine what the law aimed at.
The following passages in the oration Pro Plancio (cc. 15, 18, 19) more
particularly explain the Lex. It is easy to understand how these asso-
ciations might be used for elections. The men who managed the can-
vassing would have a list of all the ‘ sodales’ of a ‘ sodalicium,’ would
agree with them about the sum to be paid, and would bring them up to
the voting place. The voters would be much more easily managed by
one or more elever fellows looking after a single ‘sodalicium,’ which
would be kept together by party spirit, than if the canvassers had to
deal with each voter separately. There is no reason for supposing‚ as
Rein does, that the ‘ divisores ’ who were employed to secure the votes,
and ultimately to pay the bribe‚ were distinguished by the special name
of ‘sodales ;' for it is certain that all the members of a ‘sodalitas ² or
‘ sodalicium’ were called ‘sodales’ As the money was generally not
paid to the voters till the election was over, every ‘ sodalicium ’ would keep
