ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

tum quum vir amplissimus consul id illi ordini per populum dedit,
quod per senatum, si licuisset, dedisset; si in eo crimen est, quia
suffragium tulit, quis non tulit publicanus? si, quia primus scivit,

utrum id sortis esse vis an ejus qui illam legem ferebat ἓ

Si sortis,

nullum crimen est in casu, si consulis, splendor etiam Plancii,
hunc a summo viro principem ordinis esse judicatum.

17) says that the Publicani of Asia had
given too much for their farm, and they
prayed the Senate to cancel the bargain.
Cicero was in favour of the Publicani; but
Cato (Ad Att. i. 18) vigorously opposed
their demand: ‘⁴ Cato, qui miseros publi-
canos, quos habuit amantissimos sui, tertium
jam mensem vexat neque iis a senatu re-
sponsum dari patitur.'’ This is the matter
to which Cicero alludes in this chapter;
“Quum senatus impediretur quominus‚’⁷
&c. Caesar in his consulship (Rc. 59)
did nothing, or could do nothing for the
Publicani in the Senate3 but he got a Lex
carried to the effect which is stated in the
passage quoted from Suetonius. The
Equites had given too much for their bar-
gain, which had been made in the same
year in which they prayed that it might be
rescinded (B.c. 61).

But the Schol. Ambros. in the passage
quoted on c. 13, says that the ground on
which the Equites asked for a remission of
a part of what they had agreed to pay, was
the damage which they had sustained by a
hostile incmsion, and Mai adds in his note
‘ particularly in the Mithridatia war.' Such
a loss would have been a good reason for
granting their prayer (De Prov. Cons. 5,
and the note). But Cicero in the letter
(Ad Att. i. 17), instead of >tating a loss in
the Mithridatio war as the ground of the
prayer of the Publicani‚ tells us simply that
through excessive greediness they had
offered too much3 and he says “invidiosa
res, turpis postulatio et confessio temeri-
tatis.'' Resides, Cicero speaks of the bar-
gain as a recent thing. And further, it
was not possible that the claim could be
made for losses during the Mithridatio war,
for they had made this contract after the
war was over, and Cn. Pompeius had re-
turned to Rome Bc. 62.

Plancius’ father voted first (primus scivit
legem) in his ‘ tribus,' aud his ⁴ tribus' voted

first. Festus quoted by Wunder: “ Niqui-
scivit: Nam sciscito significat sententiam
dicito ac suffragium ferto3 unde scita
plebis.” See the passage in the De Domo,
c. 30, and the note. Vol. iii.

per senatum, εἰ licuisset]
Caesar would have granted this relief to the
Publicani by a vote of the Senate, if he
could have done it. As already observed,
we do not know if he attempted it and

He says that

failed through Cato’s resistauce, or whether
he thought it easier to accomplish his pur-
pose by a Plebiscitum. It seems however
that an attempt was made to give the
Equites this relief by a Scitum, and either
by Caesar or somebody else. Caesar thus
gained the good will of the Equites, and
by his agrarian Lex and other measures
he gained the Plebs. His design to make
himself the master of the State was early
formed and steadily pursued.

15. nomine leyz's Liciniae . . . es secu-
tus] Cicero says that Laterensis affected
to prosecute Plancius under the Lex Li-
cinia, but that he charged him with such
acts as were comprehended in the Leges de
Ambitu, and that he had only applied that
part of the Lex Licinia which fixed the
way of naming the Judices.

ulla in re] Ernesti followed the fewer
and worse MSS. in reading ‘nulla‚' which
he thought that the Roman usage required.
Wunder admits that the word ⁴ nisi' can
only be used, when the proposition which
is opposed to that which follows ‘ nisi’ is
negative. But he shows by examples that
it is not necessary that it should be negative
in form, if it is negative in sense, as in this
oration, c. 33: “ quid est pietas, nisi volun-
tas grata in parentes?'' Accordingly in
this passage he takes ‘ si est aequum ’ to
contain a negative by implication, “ut
nostro in loco significet ‘non est autem
aecum ulla in re nisi,''¹ διο. He writes
