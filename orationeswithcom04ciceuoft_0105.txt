XXXII. conservate igitur rei publicae, judices, civem bonarum
artium, bonarum partium, bonorum virorum. Promitto hoc vobis
et, rei publicae spondeo, si modo nos ipsi rei publicae satis fecimus,
numquam hunc a nostris rationibus sejunctum fore. Quod quum
fretus nostra familiaritate promitto, tum quod durissimis se ipse
legibus jam obligavit. Non enim potest, qui hominem consularem,
quod ab eo rem publicam violatam diceret, in judicium vocarit, ipse
esse in re publica civis turbulentus: non potest, qui ambitu ne ab·
solut-um quidem patitur esse absolutum, ipse impune umquam esse
largitor. 'Habet a M. Caelio res publica, judiees duas accusationes
vel obsides periculi vel pignora voluntatis. Quare oro obtestorque
vos, judices, ut. qua in civitate paucis his diebus Sex. Clodius
absolutus sit, quem vos per biennium aut ministrum seditionis aut
(lucem vidistis, qui aedes sacras, qui censum populi Romani, qui
memoriam publicam suis manibus incendit, hominem sine re, sine
fide, sine spe, sine sede, sine fortunis, ore, lingua, manu, vita omni
inquinatum; qui Catuli monumentum afflixit, meam domum diruit,
mei fratris incendit; qui in Palatio atque in urbis oculis servitia ad
caedem et inflammandam urbem incitavi& in hac civitate nc

the meaning: ‘if any danger should be
feared from Caelius, these prosecutions

32. bonorum virorum] Weiske proposed
to write ‘ bonorum morum,' on which Halm

says “ praeter necessitatem ;'' and perhaps he
is right. The use of the Latin genitive is
often difficult to understand.

Promitte . . . spondeo] These are tech-
nical terms used in certain forms of con-
tract (Vol. ii. Index). Cicero speaks as if
he were making himselfa surety for Caelius.
—‘rationibus sejunctum ε’ see the use of ‘ se-
junctum ' c. 30. Here he says ‘a man who
will never swerve from my prineiples,’ my
policy and my fidelity to the state.—‘ legi-
bus obligavit :’ ‘has bound himself by the
hardest, terms.’ He does not mean ‘ laws,'
though he alludes to Caelius’ two prosecu-
tions under certain ⁸ lege& one his prosecu-
tion of the consularis Antonius, and the other
his prosecution of Atratinus.

patitur] S.; the other readings ⁴ (1111,ν
‘ datur‚' arc corrupt. Wesenberg writes
⁴ patiatur‚' in which he is followed by Bake,
Klotz. and Halm. But 1 think that the
emendation is false, and that the sentence
requires a simple positive affirmation-
Though Cicero has said ‘vocarit,' that is
no reason why he could not or would not
say ⁸ patitur ’ in this part of the sentence.

obsides periculi] Hotmann calls this
an ‘obscurus locus;’ but he has suggested

would be in the nature of hostages sor the
security of the state.’

paucis his diebus]
days past.’ See Vol. i. Index, Diebus illis.
—-‘ Sex. Clodius :‘ this partizan of P. Clodius
helped to disturb the state for two years, the
year in which Cicero went into exile, and
the year in which he returned.

aedes sacrm] The aedes of the Nym-
phae (Pi-o Milone, c. 27). The ⁶ censum '
is the ‘ censoriae tabulae! The recornls
(memoria) of the Roman people were burnt
in the ⁸ tahularium.'

hominem sine re] Lambinus thought
that we should read ⁴ homo sine re . . . in-
quinatus :' Garatoni thinks that ¹hominem
sine re . . . inquinatum ⁹ should be placed
after ⁴ ducem vidistis) Ncithcr alteration
is necessary. A ‘homo sine re ’ is 11 man
who is a beggnr. ⁴ Sine re ' is the negution
of ¹ cum re ’ (llornce, Sat. ii. 5. v. 8⁸.
What follows may bc compared with a pns-
sage in the. De Domo, c. 10, about Sex.
Clodius, ¹⁴ Scilicet tu.’' δια, in which oration
we have plenty about 1110 *111011111111-11111111
Catuli ¹ and Cicero's house. (Ad Ait. iv. 2
und 3.)
