for ‘rumores,’ as for instance, “ si negabi-
mus temere famam nasci solere quin subsit
aliquid.'' Then he tells us what may be
said ⁸ contra rumores? Cicero knew how
to handle this matter. When a great deal
has been said against a man, the orator
must leave out nothing, he must place it
before his hearers, and when he has shown
how much of it is false, how the facts of
the rumours are contradieted by the facts
of the case, he may lead his hearers to infer
that all the ‘ rumores ' are equally worth-
less A strict method ofjudicial investigation
renders this useless and deprives the orator
of a beautiful common-place. For in a strict
method a rumour is nothing. We require
evidence and not report. ln the ordinary
affairs of life, when ‘rumores' are not
brought to the test of evidence before a
court, there is another way of dealing with
them, a way known to the prndent; and
that is to take no notice of them. ‘ Ru-
mores,’ when they are many and various,
are soon detected and known to be false,
and what is known of some, may be pre-
sumed of the rest, except that the good-
natured and the virtunus in their own con-
ceit will still stick to the ‘subest aliquid :’

frenorum] Τ. Ε. S. The reading is pro-
bably corrupt.

Ocriculanam] A villa at Ocriculum, the
most southern town of Umbria, near the
Tiber, and on the Via Flaminia, and about
forty-four miles from Rome. Otricoli, the
modern town, is near the old site. We
must infer that Milo had a villa there.

domus . . . referta] ‘domum . . .
fertam,¹ Klotz; and the accusative seems
at first sight almost necessary; but second
thoughts show that the words ⁴ nullum in
urbe . . . esset domus' are parenthetical,
and ‘arma' and this nominative (domus)
must be connected with the beginning of
the sentence.

malleolorum] See In Cat. i. 13, and
the note.

Quin etiam . . .sueri!] ‘ fuit ’ ed. Jun-
tina, Halm, Baiter. T. E. S. have ‘ fuerit ;'
most of the MSS. have ⁴ sit! Madvig pro-
poses ‘ cui (Pompeio) etiam . . . fuerit.' which
is ingenious, and isit is not right, it ought
to be.

popa] A man employed at sacrifices. to
kill the animal, as it is said. He carried
bits home. Persius (vi. 73) has ‘popa
venter' (see Macleane’s note). llalni says :
