450 INTRODUGTION

state during Antonius’ administration. His way of life was still the
same: he turned night into day, eating, drinking, and amusing himself
with worthless fellows and his favourite woman Cytheris. The tribune
P. Cornelius Dolabella wished to get an insolvency act passed, with the
view, it seems, of taking the benefit of it himself. His colleague, L.
Trebellius, professed to be in favour of the aristocracy⁷3 and between
them they filled Rome with violence and blood. Antonius at last
brought the soldiers into Rome, who cut down eight hundred men (Livy,
Ep. 113). Caesar’s arrival in September restored order, but nobody
was punished ; Dolabella even received favours from Caesar. When the
property of Cn. Pompeius was sold, Antonius was one of the buyers,
though he never paid the purchase-money, and soon spent what he got.
He lived in Pompeius’ house. Dolabella got two of Pompeius’ villae
(Phil. xiii. c. 5).

Before the end of the year Caesar left Rome for the African war. On
being appointed Dictator again he named M. Aemilius Lepidus his
master of horse. Antonius did not join Caesar in the African war,
which was ended in about six months.

In B.c. 47 Antonius married his third wife. His first wife was Fadia,
the daughter of a freedman, Q. Fadius (Phil. ii. c. 2); his second
wife was his c'ousin Antonia, daughter of C. Antonius, whom he put
away on a charge of adultery with P. Dolabella. His third wife, Fulvia,
had been the wife of P. Clodius, Cicero's enemy, and then of O. Scribo-
nius Curio, who perished in Africa in Bc. 49. Her third husband was
M. Antonius. It has seldom been a woman's lot to have three such
dissolute fellows for husbands. Fulvia was a match for Antonius, and
she governed him for a long time. Plutarch (Antonius, c. 10) says,
“ Cleopatra was indebted to Fulvia for training Antonius to woman—mle,
inasmuch as Cleopa-tra received him quite tamed and disciplined from
the commencement to obey women.''

Antonius did not accompany Caesar in his Spanish war of Rc. 45.
They were not on their former friendly footing, because Caesar ‘pressed
for payment for what Antonius had bought, and Antonius thought that
his services entitled him to keep without paying. Cicero says that be-
fore Caesar set out on his Spanish campaign he allowed Antonius a little
longer time for payment (Phil. ii. c. 29), and he also speaks of Anto-
nius about this time having formed a design against Caesar’s life. A
great part of the scandalous talk in the second Philippic cannot be ac-
cepted as the exact truth.

Antonius went some distance from Rome to meet Caesar on his return
from Spain after the defeat of the sons of Cn. Pompeius. They were
now reconciled‚ and no more is said about Antonius making good his
payments. Extraordinary honours were paid to the great conqueror.
