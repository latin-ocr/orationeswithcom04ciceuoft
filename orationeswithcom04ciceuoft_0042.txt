20 ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

filio principe juventutis, cum re publica conjunctiore etiam quam ab
illa aetate postulandum fuit, delere voluisti: L. Domitium, cujus
dignitas et splendor praestringebat, credo, oculos Vatinii, quem tu
propter commune odium in bonos oderas, in posterum autem,
propter omnium spem, quae de illo est atque erat, ante aliquanto
timebas: L. Lentulum hunc judicem nostrum, flaminem Martialem,
quod erat eo tempore Gabinii tui competitor, ejusdem Vettii indicio
opprimere voluisti, qui si tum illam labem pestemque vicisset,
quod ei tuo scelere non licuit, res publica victa non esset. Hujus ¹
etiam filium eodem indicio et crimine ad patris interitum aggregare
voluisti. L. Paullum, qui tum quaestor Macedoniam obtinebat,

show that Cicero has been speaking of some-
body else in the preceding clause, and we
therefore require some name with ¹ oculos.’

Abi-ami z ‘⁴ Curio pater quadam Caesarem
oratione omnium mulierum virum et omnium
virorum mulierem appellat'’ (sueton. Caesar,

c. 52). Meyer (Orat. Frag. p. 165, 2nd ed.).

principe juventutis] “This is a mere
honourable appellation, for Curio, the son,
is not so called, because he was entered first
in the Album Equitum by the censors”
(Halm), who refers to Garatoni's note on
the oration Pro Sulla, c. 12. (See the note
Vol. iii.) But Halm observes that Becker
(R'o'm. Alt. ii. l, p. 288, note 592) is of a
different opinion. Becker says, the ex-
pression * Princeps J uventutis ¹ occurs even
in the Republican time. lt is altogether
like the expression ⁴ Princeps Senatus,' and
indicates the person first named in reading
over the list of the Equites (Cic. Ad Fam.
iii. ll. In Vatin. 10). Accordingly also
in Ovid, Art. i. 194, in reference to C.
Caesar, we read, ‘⁶ Nunc juvenum princeps,
deinde future senum.'' However, it was
under Augustus that the name ‘Princeps
Juventutis,’ πρόκριτης or προκριθεὶς τῆς
νεότητος, received a higher signification.
Caius and Lucius, the emperor’s grandsons,
were presented by the Equites themselves
with a shield and silver lance, and saluted
as Principes Juventutis. Monum. Ancyr.:
‘⁶ Equites autem Romani universi Principem
Juventutis utrumque eorum parmis et hastis
argenteis donatum appellaverunt.'' See also
Tacit. Ann. i. 33 Dion Cassius 55, c. 12;
Zonaras x. 35.

L. Domitium] He was praetor in the year
after Caesar's consulship, and made a motion
in the senate in conjunction with C. Mem-
mius for rescinding Caesar‘s acta. Dru·
mann, iii. 18.

oculos· Vatinii] The name ⁴ Vatinii'
makes a difficulty, and Madvig supposes
that it has been inserted' m the text by some
copier who wished to explain the meaning.
But as Halm remarks, the words‘ quem tu'

He proposes to write ‘ oculos Vettii!

in posterum] ‘ for the future ’ you feared
him; seared what he would do sometime
later. It was expected that as praetor he
would rescind Caesar’s measures3 audit
was now expected that he would do as
consul what he had not been able to do as
praetor. Domitius when he was a candi-
date for the consulship (Rc. 55) threatened
that he would do this, and would take
Caesar’s troops from him. Caesar got
Pompeius and Crassus to meet him at
Luca, which was within his province of
Gallia Cisalpina, and induced themato be
candidates for the consulship a second time
in order to frustrate L. Domitius (Sueton.
Caesar, c. 243 Cicero, Ad Atticum iv. 8) (Go-
veanus). Crassus and Pompeius were elected.
See Plutarch, Pompeius, c. 51, who tells
the story of Pompeius’ election; and his
Life of Caesar, c. 21.

Gabinii lui] Gabinius and Piso were the
consuls of uc. 58, and succeeded Caesar and
Bibulus (Β c. 59). Cicero says if Lentulus
had been elected consul in place of Gabinius,
the state would not have suffered from the
turbulent tribunate of P. Clodius, which
was in the year of Gabinius' consulship, and
effected Cicero’s expulsion from Rome.

The crime of Vatinius, by which he pre-
vented Lentulus from being elected, seems
to be his subornation of Vettius to accuse
Lentulus of being one of the conspirators
against Pompeius, and this charge was
the cause of Lentulus losing his election.
Drumann, ii. 552; iii. 45.

filium] His name also was L. Lentulus

Cic. Ad Q. Fr. iii. l). · ‘⁸ L. Lentulus,
aminis filius.’ Vettius named Lentulus, the
son, als 0 as an accomphce m the conspiracy.

L. Paicllicm] He held the province of
