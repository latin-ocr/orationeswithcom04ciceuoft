INTRODUGTION TO THE TWELFTH PHILIPPIC.

THE consul Pansa had moved 1711317 another Legatio should be 561117 170
M. Antonius, and P. Servilius and Cicero had been named among the
Legabi (c. 7). Cicero in this speech now contends that there is no use
in sending anot-her LegabiQ and that 117 was 11017 proper for him 170 be one
of 17116 Legati. His life, he says, would 11017 116 safe; 11111111] would be more
for 17116 1111616517 of 17116 state that he should 11017 116 exposed 170 171115 danger.
Ab 17116 end of ‘che speech he seems 170 say that he will 6011561117 to go (c.
12), 111117 116 does 11017 speak very plain, and the last sentence leaves his
resolution uncertain. Dion (46, c. 32) says ‘that some of the partizans
of Antonius persuaded 17116 senabe 170 send 0171161· Legati ‘co Antonius,
and Cicero among 17116111 ; 011 the pretexb thar Cicero would persuade
Antonius 170 come to terms, bui: in truth that they might be rid of him.
Cicero having considered about} 171115 was afraid, and would 11017 venturo
170 trust himself within the camp of Antonius, and accordingly none of
the Legati 5617 ouh. This is what: Dion says of 17116 matter.
