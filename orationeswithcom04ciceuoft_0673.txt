XII. Num igitur Brutus exspectavit decreta nostra, quum studia
nosset? Neque enim est in provinciam suam Cretam profec-
tus3 in Macedoniam alienam advolavit; omnia sua putavit quae
vos vestra esse velitis; legiones conscripsit novas, excepit veteres;
equitatum ad se abduxit Dolabellae, atque eum nondum tanto par-
ricidio oblitum hostem sua sententia judicavit. Nam ni ita esset,
quo jure equitatum a consule abduceret? Quid G. Cassius, pari
magnitudine animi et consilii praeditus, nonne eo ex Italia consilio
profectus est ut prohiberet Syria Dolabellam? Qua lege, quo jure?
Eo quod J uppiter ipse sanxit, ut omnia quae rei publicae salutaria

essent legitima et justa haberentur.

appear to be loosely connected with what
precedes. It seems as if Cicero felt a diffi-
culty in expressing what he had to say:
‘ he should consider it equivalent to a de-
cree, that there should be such men as
Brutus and Cassius, each with an army, one
of them near, and the other distant, but
following Dolabella'

notus] M. Brutus' army, which was
near Italy. ‘ Auditus ’ the army of C.
Cassius, who was in Syria (Manutius).

pec-tabit et noscet '’ (F. Ursini). In place of
⁴ Num . . . nosset ? ' some editions have ‘ Non
. . . nosset! Halm says that i has ‘ Non.'

suam Cretam] See lntrod. p. 456.-‘ Ma-
cedoniam alienam& the province of Hor-
tensius, says Manutius ; who does not think
that ‘alienam ’ means that Macedonia had
become C. Antonius’ province by virtue of
the ‘ sortitio ’ made in the consulship of M.
Antonius (Phil. iii. c. 10: ¹ C. Antonius Ma-
cedoniam'), for the province was afterwards
taken from him (Phil. x. 0. 6); “ aut certe
homo verecundus in Macedoniam non ucce-
dit ne contra S.C. fecisse videatur.'’

velitis] ‘velletis’ g i.—-‘ oblitum :' “ob-
strictum doctus nescio quis ut est ἐξ 14
et 29 (e. 6, and 0. 12)” (Halm). ⁸ Parricidio’
is Dolabellals murder. See Vol. i. Index,
‘ Parricidium!

Quid C. Cassius ..... nonne] ‘ Quid
C. Cassius, . . . nonne' &c. Objections
have been made to the pointing iu the text.
11οἀ others object to the pointing ⁴ Quid?
C. Cassius‚’ &c. See Index, Vol. 1,, ‘ Quid)
It is admitted on both sides thnt ‘Quid '
is interrogative. The sentence begins
‘Quid C. Cassius: where one muy easily
supply, if he likes, ‘fecit’ But the 500-
tence is not complcted, nud it begins again
with ‘nonuel ‘Quid’ in such sentences

Est enim lex nihil aliud nisi

is an imperfect interrogation. If a note of
interrogation is to be used, I think that it
is more appropriate to place it after ‘ C.
Cassius,’ or after ‘ praeditus!

essent . . . haberentur] Bake. in his
edition of Cicero De Legibus, p. 478, cor-
rects the passage thus: ‘sunt . . . haben-
tur,’ which Halm rightly rejects, observing
that the words depend on ⁴ profectus est.'
As to ⁴ sanxit,’ sec Vol. i. Index, ⁴ Sanctio
legis!

Est enim leoe nilzz'l aliud] He uses Lex
in a wide sense, for Law generally. It is
a definition which suits Cicero's purpose.
A Law commands either to do or 10101·-
bear, but such a command can only come
from a sovereign power, and it is still a Lex
whether it is good or bad, as we know by
‹laily experience. Cassius’ Lex however
is what Cicero calls ‘ lex naturae,' which in
some cases supersedes ‘leges scriptae‚’ or
Laws properly 50 called. His ‘lex ua-
turae' is the so-called law of sels-preser-
vation.

This matter of Lex is discussed by Cicero
in the De Legibus ii. c. 4, and he concludes
thus, c. 5: ‘⁴ Ergo est lex justorum injusto-
rumque distinctio, ad illum antiquissimam
ct rerum omnium principem expressa nn-
101301, ad quam leges hominum diriguntur.
quae supplicio improbos afficiunt, defen-
dunt ac tuentur bonos.” Cicero knew
what a Lex was. but when 110 writes ns a
