GAP. 18, 19. 113

rogatas jure latas negant, iidem illam proscriptionem capitis mei
contra salutem rei publicae, sed salvis auspiciis rogatam esse dice-
bant. Itaque vir summa auctoritate, summa eloquentia, dixit
, graviter casum illurn meum funus esse rei publicae, sed funus justum
et indictum. Mihi ipsi omnino perhonorificum [est] discessum
meum funus dici rei publicae. Reliqua non reprehend03 sed mihi
ad id quod sentio assumo. Nam si illud jure rogatum dicere ausi
sunt, quod nullo exemplo fieri pot-uit, nulla lege licuit, quia nemo
de caelo servarat, oblitine erant tum, quum ille qui id egerat plebeius
est lege curiata factus, dici de caelo esse servatum? Qui si plebeius
omnino esse non potuit, qui tribunus pl. potuit esse? et cujus tribu-
natus si ratus est, nihil est quod irritum ex actis Caesaris possit

spoken of. He says ‘J ulias leges ’ after Ro-
man fashion, meaning all the leges proposed
by Caesar 10 1115 consulship, which leges were
called after 1115 name. These men said that
Caesar’s leges were no leges because they
were enacted contrary to the auspicia, but
that the lex which declared the Interdictio
against Cicero, though a bad lex, was
enacted in due form.

vir summa] Manutius conjectures that
it was Bibulus, who being a consularis
might have spoken before Cicero. It could
not, he says, be M. Cato, who was not yet
Praetorius, and therefore could not have
spoken before Cicero.

justum et indictum] The same thing is
said in the De Domo (c. 16, and the note).
The ⁴ vir summa auctoritate ' said it was the
death or funeral of the state, but it was a
regular funeral made in due form, with all
proper notice. As the Romans said ‘ justum
funus,’ so they said ‘ justa facere,’ ⁴ solvere,'
‘ to perform all the funeral rites in due
form.'

ad id quod sentio assumo] He admits
all that they had said, but 110 11505 it for his
own argument, and to prove their inconsis-
tency.—‘ si illud jure rogatum ι’ if they say
that the Interdictio against Cicero was
enacted in due form, because there was no
religious impediment (quia nemo de 03010
servarat). they must not forget that there
was a religious impediment to the Lex Curi-
ata by which Clodius was made a plebeian,
for Bibulus on that occasion ⁸ de caelo ser-
vavit.

As to the expression · 110 03010 ser-
vare ’ see Vol. iii. Index, ⁴ Servare! Cicero
continues his argument. lf Clodius could
not be made a plebeian because of the reli-
gious impediment, hc could not be u tr. pl. ς
3011 if he was not duly elected a tr. pl„ none

of his measures could be legal.

cujus tribunatus si ratus est] Hotmann
proposed to read ‘ si ratus non est.y He
also approved of Lambinus' alteration
‘ nihil est quod ratum ex actis,' &c. Lam-
binus also proposed ‘ nihil est quod non ir-
ritum 3' and further on he would write ⁴ non
servata ’ for ‘ conservata! Abrami declares
that Lambinus’ emendation cannot be en-
dured, and that the sense is plain. And so
it is. The commentators are not always as
quick as their original. The antient orators
seldom made their premises and conclusions
inconsistent. They were too praetical in
their art to do that.

Cicero has just asked ; “ If Clodius could
not be made a plebeiam how could he be
made a tribunus ?’' Hc adds: ‘⁴ And when,
if Clodius’ tribunate is declared legal, there
is nothing in Caesar’s measures that cau be
illegal. shall not only Clodius’ tribunate be
legal, but even his most pestilent acts be
considered to be legally enacted, because the
respect to the auspices was observed ?’' lf
Clodius' tribunate was declarcd valid, though
he was not duly made 3 plebeiani, Caesar's
acta must be declat-cd valid too, though the
auspicia were not observed, because Bibulus
‘de caelo servavit.’ These 11100 53111 Cae-
sar's acta were illegal, because they were
against the auspices. But then Clodius’
acts were all illegal, because he was illegally
made a tribune. If Clodius was legally a
tribune, Caesar's acts were legal. The de-
fect in both cases was the same. These
⁴ sumini viri ’ must take the consequences of
their assumption, that Clodius wus- legally a
tribune3 3011 0110 consequence is. that they
cannot say that Caesar's acts were illc-gul ς
3011 will they, affirming (Yaiesar's acts 10 be
illegal, 3011 affirming Clodius' tribunatc to bo
legal, also affirm that all Clodius' mensures
