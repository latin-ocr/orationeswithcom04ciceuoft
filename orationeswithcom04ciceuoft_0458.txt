436 ORAT. PRO REGE DEIOTARO

quod ille, si esset tibi inimicissimus, numquam tamen dixisset3
ipse enim mansuetus, versus immanis. Qui autem Domitio poterat
esse amicus qui tibi esset inimicus? tibi porro inimicus cur esset, a
quo quum vel interfici belli lege potuisset, regem et se et filium
suum constitutos esse meminisset? Quid deinde furcifer, quo
progreditur? Ait hac laetitia Deiotarum elatum vino se obruisse, in
convivioque nudum saltavisse. Quae crux huic fugitivo potest
satis supplicii afferre? Deiotarum saltantem quisquam aut ebrium
vidit umquam? Omnes in illo sunt rege virtutes, quod te, Caesar,
ignorare non arbitror; sed praecipue singularis et admiranda fru-
galitas: etsi hoc verbo scio laudari regem non solere. Frugi
hominem dici non multum habet laudis in rege: fortem, justum,
severum, gravem, magnanimum, largum, beneficum, liberalem; hae
sunt regiae laudes, illa privata est. Ut volet quisque accipiat:
ego tamen frugalitatem, id est modestiam et temperantiam, virtu-
tem maximam judico. Haec in illo est ab ineunte aetate quum
a cuncta Asia, quum a magistratibus legatisque nostris, tum
ab equitibus Romanis, qui in Asia negotiati sunt, perspecta et
cognita. Multis ille quidem gradibus officiorum erga rem pub-
licam nostram ad hoc regium nomen aseendit: sed tamen quidquid
a bellis populi Romani vacabat, cum hominibus nostris consuetu-
dines, amicitias, res rationesque jungebat, ut non solum tetrarches

nudum] He is said to have got drunk
first, then to have thrown off his upper

in metrica Proverbia retulit A. Schottus,
1283'’ (Wyttenbach). We here learn that
Deiotarus knew Greek. He is said to have
had a Greek wife, or a woman with a Greek
name. The tetrarchs and nobles learned
Greek and spoke it, but the common sort
kept their Gallie dialect, as Hieronymus
tells us, who having spent some time in the
country of the Treviri knew something of
the Gallie dialeets. St. Paul addressed an
epistle in Greek to the Galatians at a
time when it is probable that the greater
part of the Galatians were too ignorant to
read any language. But we may assume that
there were many Greeks in Galatia when
the Galli settled there, that the two races
intermarried‚ and that the Greek language
and Greek civilization were thus established
and existed together with the Gallie lan-
guage and the Gallio religion.

belli [eye] The common and proper ex-
pression is ‘ belli jure.’——‘ furcifer :’ a word
of reproach. Slaves were punished for
smaller offences by wearing round the neck
a collar (furca) to which their hands were
fastened (Donatus, ad Ter. And. iii. 5. 12).

dress and to have danced (see In Cat. ii. c.
ll, and the note3 and Pro Murena, c. (i,
and the note, Vol. iii.; In Pis. c. 10, Vol.
iv.). Halm observes that the Greeks had
hired dancers at their feasts, and that. if it
happened that any of the company took to
joining them or dancing in their style, it
was generally the consequence of drunken-
ness. Likely enough. There is a dancing
scene in Xenophon’s Symposium, c. 2, in
which a Syracusan comes in with a female
flute-player and a dancing girl, who could
perform wonderful things, and a handsome
boy who played well on the lute and danced.
After this exhibition Philippus the γελωτο-
ποιός tries his skill in imitating the dancing
of the boy and the girl.

res rationesquejungebat] ‘ he had corn-
mercial transactions with our people!
‘ Res’ is the universal Roman word for
every thing. ⁴ Rationes ' is a word applied
to accounts, money reckonings. Varro (De
R. R. i. l) says that Diophanes sent to
king Deiotarus a treatise on agriculture
in six books, which was an abi-idgment of
