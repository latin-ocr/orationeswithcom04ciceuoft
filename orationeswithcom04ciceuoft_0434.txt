412 ORAT. PRO Q. LIGARIO

VII. Sed ut omittam communem caussam, veniamus ad nos-
tram. Utrum tandem existimas facilius fuisse, Tubero, Ligarium
cx Africa exire an vos 111 Africam non venire? Poteramusne, in-
quies, quum senatus censuisset? Si 1110 00050115, 011110 modo. Sed
tamen Ligarium senatus idem legaverat3 atque ille eo tempore
paruit, quum parere senatui necesse erat : vos tunc paruistis quum
paruit nemo qui noluit. Reprehendo igitur? Minime vei-03 neque
enim licuit aliter vestro generi, nomini, familiae, disciplinae. Sed

excusare. Haec ego novi propter omnes necessitudines, quae
mihi sunt 011111 L. Tuberone: domi una eruditi, militiae contuber-

7. communem caussam] ‘ to say no
more about that which applies to all!—
‘ legaverat:⁷ the senate had appointed Li-
garius a ‘legatus,' and at a time when he
was bound to obey the senate; before the
war broke out or was apprehended and
when ‘the authority of the senate was un-
disputed. Things were not so when Tubero
was sent to Africa. Caesar had invaded
Italy and the senate had no power.

quibus rebus, Sca] ‘ I will not allow you
to blame in others that which you make a
subject of boast in your own case3’ obe-
dience to the senate. ‘Gloriari' is used
sometimes with an ablative.

sors conjecta est] The name of L. Tu-
bero with other names was thrown into the
‘ urna.’ The ⁴ sortes ’ were shaken and then
drawn out by the hand to determine who
should have the office. Caesar (B. C„ i. 30)
says: “Africam Tubero sorte obtinere de-
bebat.'' Caelius in a letter to Cicero (Ad
Div. viii. 8) reports the terms of a Senatus-
consultum for the determination of the
governors of provinces by lot: ‘¹ si ii ad
numerum non essent, tunc deinceps proximi
cujusque collegii qui praetores fuissent ne-
quein provincias profecti essent in sortem
conjicerentur, quoad is numerus effectus
esset quem ad numerum in provincias mitti
oporteret.”

excusare] To make a legal excuse on the
ground of bad health. The word is often
used with a case after it. The Romans
could say ‘excusare morbum.’ See Excu-
satio, Index, Vol. iii.

cum L. Tuberone] See Pro Plancio, c.

41 and the note. The intimacy of Cicero
and L. Tubero began when they were boys,
and it was continued in the camp. Cicero
saw something of the Marsic or Italic war
under Cn. Pompeius Strabo. Cicero does
not mean that their education was at home
in their fathers‘ house, as the word ¹ una'
shows 3 but ‘ domi ' is opposed to ⁶ militiae?
They went together to some school or
master. Plutarch, who may have found the
anecdote somewheoe, for Ι (10 001 suppose
that he invented it, speaks of Cicero’s school
reputation (Cicero, c. 2). It was the fashion
in Cicero's time to send boys to 50110015.
Quintilian (i. e. 2), always a wise and
safe adviser, shows the advantage of boys
being brought up together. He says: “Ante
omnia futurus orator, cui in maxima cele-
britate et 111 media rei publicae luce viven-
dum est, assuescet jam a tenero non re-
formidare homines neque illa solitaria et
velut umbratili vita pallescere.'‘ He speaks
of friendships thus formed which continue
all through life: ‘⁴ neque enim est sanctius
sacris iisdem quam studiis initiari.’' What
follows 15 a simple but most valuable obser-
vation: “ Sensum ipsum, qui communis
dicitur, ubi discet, quum se a congressu,
qui non hominibus solum, sed mutis quoque
animalibus naturalis est, segregarit? Adde
quod domi ea sola discere potest quae ipsi
praecipientur; in schola etiam quae aliis.'⁷
Here ‘domi ' 15 opposed to ⁴ schola!
ayebat] There is a reading ‘aiebat,’ of
small authority. This ‘quidam‚' whoever
he is, urged him, ¹ agebat cum e0.’ Baiter
says nothing of the readings. Some of the
