If Cicero as a man does not command admiration or respect, 110

letters shall endure: he has got that immortality which he has
often spoken of, and the anticipation of which was a motive to his
unwearied labour. As he said of his friend Servius Sulpicius, “the
life of the dead rests in the remembrance of the livingf' If his
writings were lost, there would be an immense blank 111 Roman
