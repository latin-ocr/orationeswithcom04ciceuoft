284 ORAT. PRO CN. PLANCIO

celebratum sit aut hominibus auditum atque notum. Ego enim,
Laterensis, ex illo incendio legum, juris, senatus, bonorum omnium
cedens, quum mea domus ardore suo deflagrationem urbi atque
Italiae toti minaretur nisi quievissem, Siciliam petivi animo, quae
ct ipsa erat mihi sicut domus una conjuncta et obtinebatur a
C. Vergilio, quocum me uno vel maxime quum vetustas, tum
amicitia, quum mei fratris collegia, tum rei publicae caussa
sociarat. Vide nunc caliginem temporum illorum. Quum ipsa*
paene insula mihi sese obviam ferre vellet, praetor ille, ejusdem
tribuni plebis contionibus propter eandem rei publicae caussam
saepe vexatus, nihil amplius dico nisi me in Siciliam venire noluit.
Quid dicam? O. Vergilio, tali civi et viro, benevolentiam in me,
memoriam communium temporum, pietatem, humanitatem, fidem
defuisse? Nihil, judices, est eorum, sed quam tempestatem nos
vobiscum non tulissemus, metuit ut eam ipse posset opibus suis
sustinere. Tum consilio repente mutato iter a Vibone Brundisium
terra petere contendi3 nam maritimos cursus praecludebat hiemis
magnitudo.

XLI. Quum omnia illa municipia, quae sunt a Vibone Brun-
disium, in fide mea judices, essent, iter mihi tutum multis mini-
tantibus magno cum suo metu praestiterunt. Brundisium veni,
vel potius ad moenia accessi. Urbem unam mihi amicissimam

even go to Melita (Malta), which was in the
province of Vergilius (see Index, Vol. i.,
Melita). He went to Brundisium by land
to avoid the sea voyage in bad weather3 and
from Brundisium he crossed over to Epirus.

petiz-i animo] He means ‘intended to go
to Sicily,’ and he set out, but got no further
than Vibo (Bivona), on the west coast of
the Bruttii. He had always maintained
friendly relations with Sicily since he was

quaestor in that island.

Veryilz'o] T. E. This is the orthography
of this name in the best and oldest MSS,
and in inscriptions (Wunder).—‘ quum ve-
tustas, tum amicitia:’ the reading of Ε.,
which is better than the old reading ⁴ vetusta
amicitia.’—‘ collegia :' his conjunction with
Q. Cicero as his colleague in the praetor-
ship. After his praetorship Quintus had
the government of Asia, and Vergilius of
Sicily (Manutius).

iter . . . petere] Ernesti thought that
‘iter’ should be erased. But Ruhnken,
quoted by Garatoni, proves that the Ro-
mans wrote so, as Livy 44, c. 2: ‘⁴ quod
iter petiturus esset ignarus.’'

Cicero in one of his letters (Ad Att. iii.
4) says that he suddenly left- Vibo, because
he there received news that the ternis of the
Rogatio, which finally was passed, did not
allow him to stay within four hundred
miles; and for this reason he could not

When Cicero left Rome he intended to
visit Sicily, where he expected a welcome
reception. He does not say where he re-
ceived notice that Vergilius would not allow
him to enter his province. He makes his
reason for leaving Vibo all at once to be
Vergilius’ refusa13 but in the letter to Atti-
cus he states another reason. There is
some difficulty in the passage of Cicero's
letter (Ad Att. iii. 4) about the words, ¹ Illo
quum pervenire non liceret ;’ but it does
not belong to the present place to attempt
to explain it.
