636 INTRODUCTION.

Cicero carried his motion3 but the inference is false. There is a letter
of Cicero to Cassius (Ad Div. xii. 7) in which he says that his proposal
would have been carried in the senate, if the consul Pansa had not
vehemently opposed him. After the meeting in the senate he says that
he was brought for-ward to address the people by the Tr. pl. M. Ser-
vilius. This letter seems to refer to the matter discussed in the Eleventh
Philippic. The letter of Lentulus also to Cicero (Ad Div, xii. 14,
written at the end of May B.o. 43) shows, as Drumann observes (Gre-
schichte Roms 1. p. 275), that Cicero’s proposal was not accepted by the
senate3 and we must conclude that the senate gave the provinces of
Asia and Syria to the consuls Hirtius and Pansa, with authority
to conduct the war against Dolabella, though they would not leave
Italy until Mutina was relieved, and they must act in the mean time by
de uty.

lCicero had said (Ad Div. xii. 7) that Cassius would not wait for the
senate’s commission, and he did not. In his letter to Cicero (Ad Div.
xii. 11) early in March he styles himself Proconsul. But the senate did
not acknowledge Cassius as proconsul until after the defeat of Antonius
before hiutina and the death of both the consuls Hirtius and Pansa.
Velleius (ii. 62) however says that both Brutus and Cassius were ac-
knowledged as rightfully in possession of their provinces after the battle
of Mutina3 and Appian says that both of them were acknowledged be-
fore the battle.
