92 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

legem generi tui dicere liceret: id emptum ita vendidisti, ut aut jus
non diceres aut bonis cives Romanos everteres. Quorum ego nihil
dico, patres conscripti, nunc inhominem ipsum, de provincia disputo.
Itaque onmia illa. quae et saepe audistis et tenetis animis, etiam si
non audiatis, praetermitto: nihil de hac ejus urbana quam ille
praesens in mentibus vestris oculisque defixit audacia loquor, nihil
de superbia, nihil de contumacia, nihil de crudelitate disputo.
Lateant libidines ejus illae tenebricosae, quas fronte et supercilio,
non pudore et temperantia contegebat: de provincia quod agitur id ,
disputo. Huic vos non summittetis? hunc diutius manere pati-
emini? cujus, ut provinciam tetigit, sic fortuna cum improbitate
certavit, ut nemo posset utrum posterior an infelicior esset judicare.
An vero in Syria diutius est Semiramis illa retinenda? cujus iter
in provinciam fuit ejusmodi, ut rex Ariobarzanes consulem vestrum
ad caedem faciendam tamquam aliquem Thracem conduceret.
Deinde adventus in Syriam primus equitatus habuit interitum:
post concisae sunt optimae cohortes. Igitur in Syria imperatore
illo nihil aliud neque * * actum est nisi pactiones pecuniarum cum
tyrannis, decisiones, direptiones, latrocinia, caedeS, quum palam
populi Romani imperator instructo exercitu dexteram tendens non

that Cicero says, particularly in his abuse.

tenebricosae] Cicero is full of such allu-
—‘ Ariobarzanes :’ the name of some of

sions to Piso's habits (In Pison. 0. 63 Pro

Sestio, c. v, 10), and to his grave, solemn, the Cappadocian kings. This was Ario-

and hypocritical looks.

summittens] ⁴ will you not send him a
successor, Supersede him ? ’ Piso was both
bad and unlucky. ‘ Felicitas,' or good for-
tune, was part of a man’s qualifications for
governinent. Pro Sex. Rosc. Am. c. 8,
note; De Imp. Cn. Pomp. c. 10, note.—
‘posterior:’ C. Lambinus altered it to
⁴ protervior,’ which Baiter has. He observes
that ⁴ posterior ' is supported by a fragment
of C. Gracchus (Gellius xv. 12, “ omnium
natorum postremissimum nequissimum-
que ''), and by the In Pison. c. 27. But he
adds that the passage in Gracchus 15 diffe-
rent, and that in the In Pisonem is cor-
rected from the Cod. Vat. Stin ‘ posterior ’
may be right, Ι think.

Semiramis illa] Gabinius in Syria, like
the famed Assyrian queen of mythical
memory. ‘⁶ On account of his effeminacy‚''
says Klotz, ‘⁴ Cicero very appropriately com-
pares Gabinius, who now governed Syria,
with the well-known Assyrian queen Semi-
ramis ;'’ with the queen whose story repre-
sents her as a warrior and a masculine
woman. Very appropriate indeed. But it
is not our business to find propriety in all

barzanes 11,, Philopator, who was afterwards
assassinated. -ψ ⁵ concisae sunt ε’ compare
Pro Sestio, 0. 33. Cicero speaks of Ga-
binius’ losses in Syria. Josephus (B. J.
i. 6) says that Gabinius was successful in
an expedition against Alexander, the son of
Aristobulus. Perhaps Gabinius sustained
some loss in this expedition, and Cicero
does not- care to 511031( of his success.

neque * *] A word appears to have
dropped out. Madvig writes ‘neque cogi-
tatum neque actum! The ‘ tyranni ’ were
Ariobarzanes, Hyrcanus the Jew, and
others mentioned by Josephus (Antiq. J ud.
xiv. 11, referred to by Abrami).—‘deci-
siones:’ ‘terms,' and ‘final settlements.’
by which Gabinius got something. See
Vol. i. Index, ‘ decidere! Gabinius did
nothing but rob and plunder‚ as Cicero
says (In Pison. c. 17).

dexteram tendens] As a Roman general
when he addressed his men. This was an
‘ allocutio,’ which we see represented on
coins (on one of Galba, for instance), where
the general is standing on an elevated place
(suggestus), and addressing the soldiers.
Here Gabinius uses the attitude, but for a
