siones' means property in land—‘non
calumnia litium ι’ not by vexatious suits
for the purpose of disturbing good titles.
See Calumnia, Index, Vol. i.—⁴ vindiciis ac
sacramentis :' he means the action for the
recovery of land. See Vol. ii., Index, Vin-
dicatio, and Sacramentum.—‘castris:’ he
represents Clodius as making his aggres-
sions on other peoples’ land in the form os
a regular campaign. He pitched his camp,
and then made his attack (signis inferendis).
Caesar (B. G. ii. 25), “cohortatus milites
signa inferre: '’ and iii. e. 26.

decempedis] Measuring rods or chains.

 

nulla decempedis
Metata privatis opacam

Porticus excipiebat Arcton.'’
(Horace, Carm. ii. 15.)

—‘ Janiculo :' from the hill on the right side
of the Tiber at Rome, up to the Alps. It
appears that Clodius had large possessions
in Etruria, and the orator signifies in these
terms his unbounded greediness and desire
to extend them.

Prilio] P.; ‘ perelio’ T. E.; ⁴ pretio' S.,
which is probably intended for ⁴ Prelio.’ It
is supposed that it may be the Lacus
Aprilis of the Roman Itineraries, and the
modern Lago di Castiglione‚ on the coast
of Etruria, north of the mouth of the
Umbro (Ombrone).—‘ inspectante . . . in
alieno? the owner might look on quietly,

to Paconius, according to the doctrine
“superficies solo cedit” (Gaius, ii. 73),
what is fixed in the ground follows the
ownership of the ground. When a man
was a ¹ bonae fidei possessor,' that is, when
he was in possession as owner, and thought
that he was rightly in possession, if the
true owner saw that he was building on the
ground and made no objection‚ the owner
could not recover possession of his land
without indemnifying for the materials and
the labour the man who had built on it
(Scaevola, Dig. 41. 1. 7, ξ 12). But here
the owner is supposed to be frightened by
Clodius, who knew that the land was not
his own.

‘Arma' are implements and tools for build-
ing. The word ⁴ inspectante' moved
Abrami's feelings. He says, “ Pathos ab
aspectu ut illud Pallantis 10 AEneidos.”

ausus est] ‘ausum esse’ Baiter. In this
long tedious sentence, we don’t care which
it is. We don't expect to see a man arrive
at the end of such a period without stumb-
lin .

ῗνιονίιιηιη] He threatened to bring a
corpse into Furfanius’ house, that the poor
man might come under suspicion of having
committed a murder. It is pitiable to see
the great orator reduced to talking such
nonsense. Would Clodius bring in the
body by day or by night? If by day, and
against the will of Furfanius, as we may
