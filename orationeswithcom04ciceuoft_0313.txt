INTRODUGTION. 291

Gabinius' property was not sufficient to pay the sum which he was
condemned to pay 3 but there was a clause in the Lex J ulia De Repetundis
which empowered the court to recover any money which the condemned
person had improperly received, if it could be traced to another person’s
hand. This is the case of Rabirius, who was charged with having got
into his hands in some way some of the money which Gabinius had
illegally received. As Cicero had defended Gabinius he could consis-
tently defend Rabirius, particularly as he would thus please his great
friend and patron, who had now just returned to Gallia from his second
British expedition.

O. Rabirius’ father was named either C. Curius or C. Curtius; per-
haps the lat-ter is his true name. The son was adopted by his mother's
brother, C. Rabirius, whose name accordingly he took (Pro Rabirio
Post. c. 17). This C. Rabirius is supposed to be the man whom Cicero
had defended B.c. 63 on a charge of Perduellio (Vol. ii.). We know no
more about Postumus than what this oration tells us, and that he was
sent into Sicily by C. Caesar in the African war (Bell. Afric. c. 8). He
was engaged in the intrigues of Cn. Pompeius and Caesar, as we see from,
the facts of his dealings with King Ptolemaeus, his accompanying Gabi-
nius to Egypt, and Caesar’s giving him money in his difficulties. If he
was convicted it does not follow, so far as I know, that he went into
exile3 but if he did, he was restored with his friend Gabinius by his
great patron Caesar, who, as we have seen, employed him in the Civil

War.
