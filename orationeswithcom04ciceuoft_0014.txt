viii PREFACE.

morous, sarcastic, ironical, satirical; and when he was malignant.
his mouth was most foul and his bite most venomous. His ar-
gumentative power, his way of handling· given facts, and getting
out of them all that he wanted for his purpose, is really admirable,
and more admirable than easy to imitate.

Such a writer is well worth studying3 and he has left behind
him more than most people will have time to read with care. In
fact, out of the wreck of antiquity there is still left enough, and
more than enough, good matter for a man to einploy his life 0113
and much more than any person can read whose Classical studies
are only intended to be a part of his education and a useful dis-
cipline. Instead, therefore, of recommending young men to read
more of the best ancient writers than they do, and to read even
those of little value, of whom there is plenty, I think that they
should read only as much as they can read well in a limited time3
for it is only by reading well, and not by reading much, that a man
is formed and fashioned for use. These who have leisure to con-
tinue their classical studies in after life, though literature may not
be their occupation, can select what best suits their taste; but
I think that every man of sense would rather read over twenty
times something good than waste his time on what is of less value;
his object being, as I presume, improvement and pleasure‚ and not
the idle curiosity of reading something because it is either old or
new, or because nobody else reads it. That kind of reading is in-
temperance, and a sign of an unhealthy appetite. For the same
reason, Isuppose a man of sense would rather see a few choice
works of art every day than run about to look at all the rubbish
which ill-directed industry has produced.

I think that a careful study of some of Cicero’s orations is an
excellent discipline for youth; but it is not easy for young students
to read these orations with profit. The Greek and Roman orators
ought to be the last writings which a young student is brought- t0;
and this remark applies more particularly to Cicero ³. The matter
is so varied, a great deal of it so technical, the facts alluded to are

³ See F. A. Wols’s Remarks on reading the Orators: Orat. adv. Leptinem, Ep. ad
Reiz. p. x; and Erasmus, Ad Hervagianam primam, Praefatio. Wolf has also some
good remarks (p. xxvii) on the reading of the worthless part of ancient literature.
