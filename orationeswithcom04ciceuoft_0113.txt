Byzantiorum fuisse refertissimam atque ornatissimam signis quis
ignorat? quae illi exhausti sumptibus bellisque maximis, quum
omnes Mithridaticos impetus totumque Pontum armatum efferves-
centem in Asiam atque erumpentem ore, repulsum et cervicibus
interclusum suis sustinerent, tum, inquam, Byzantii et postea signa
illa et reliqua urbis ornamenta sanctissime custodita tenuerunt,
te imperatore infelicissimo et taeterrimo, Caesonine Calventi, civitas
libera et proximis suis beneficiis a senatu et a populo Romano liberata
sie spoliata atque nudata est, ut, nisi C. Vergilius legatus vir fortis
et innocens intervenisset, unum signum Byzantii ex maximo numero
nullum haberent. Quod fanum in Achaia, qui locus aut lucus in
Graecia tota tam sanctus fuit, in quo ullum simulacrum, ullum orna-
mentum reliquum sit? Emisti a foedissimo tribuno plebis tum in
illo naufragio hujus urbis, quarn tu idem qui gubernare debueras
everteras, tum, inquam, emisti grandi pecunia, ut tibi de pecuniis
creditis jus in liberos populos contra senatus consulta et contra

4. quum omnes] Baiter added ‘ omnes,'
following Halm, the authority for which is a
reading ⁴ cumnis.’

erumpentem ore] E. has ‘erumpentem
more.' In some editions there is ⁴ aegre '
for ‘ ore.' ‘ Ore' belongs to ‘ erumpentem,'
as Baiter supposes, following Madvig. Cicero
represents Pontus as falling on Byzantium
with open mouth, but repelled. The word
‘ suis ' refers to the Byzantii. If Cicero
had said ‘ cervicibus suis ’ only, the mean-
ing would have been clearer. Livy says
(22, e. 33) : ‘⁴ etsi bellum ingens in cervici-
bus erat;” ‘ on their backs,' as we say.
Cicero says (Verr. ii. 5, c. 42): “quum
istius avaritiae poenam collo et cervicibus
suis sustinerent.'’ See also Pro Sestio, c. 66 ;
Pro Milone, 28, ‘⁴ a cervicibus vestris rep—
puli ;'' and In Cat. 3, c. 7. If ‘interclusum'
means ‘stopped‚’ ‘checked,’ it seems out
of place. It should follow ‘ suis,’ because
the meaning is ⁴ cervicibus . . sustinerent.’

Caesonine] This is intended as a term
of reproach. See Quum Senatui, c. 6, and
the note, Vol. iii.—‘ proximis:’ C. Baiter
following Madvig writes ¹ pro eximiis‚' which
is an ingenious alteration. Piso, like Verres,
had a taste for art ; οι· perhaps he intended
to sell the statues. G. has Vergilius 3 P. E.
have Virgilius. He is an unknown person.

in illo naufrayio] In P. Clodius' tribune-
ship. Cicero says that Piso gave Clodius
money to get a Lex enacted by which he
should have ‘ jurisdictio ’ over the ‘liberae
civitates) A Lex of C. Julius Caesar,
Piso’s son-in-law, ‘ De Provinciis‚' had re-
cognized the privileges of the ¹ liberae civi-

tates‚' and made various regulations for the
better administration of the provinces.
Cicero often alludes to this Lex (In Pison.
c. 16, and 24). Cicero says that Piso ob-
tained jurisdiction over the ⁴ liberi populi '
in matters of ‘ pecuniae creditae‚' or debts
generally. Cicero says ‘ pecuniae creditae)
but he means ⁴ res' also; as the later
writers expressed it (De Rebus creditis, Dig.
12, tit. 1). It would be foreign to the sub-
ject to examine fully the sense of ⁴ credere ’
in such legal transactions as are the founda-
tion οἲ a ⁶ condictio.⁷ It is done by savigny,

following which is from him will be useful :
‘⁶ The original signification of creditor and
debitor applies to a claim which arises out
ofa loan of nioney; from this the term is
extended to the general notion of claims.
for which there was no other name, and this
extended use of the word then became the
common use: (Dig. 50. 16. 10;) ‘Sed et
si non sit mutua pecunia, sed contractus,
creditores accipiuntur;’ and (ll): ⁴ Credi-
torum appellatione non hi tautum accipi-
untur qui pecuniam crediderunt, sed omncs
quibus ex qualibet causa debeturl The
words which are opposed to one another,
plainly show that the limitation ot' the ex-
pression to a loan was the proper and
original sense, and that it was only ncces-
sity which brought the Romans ¹0 adopt
the inore extended meaning. und then to
