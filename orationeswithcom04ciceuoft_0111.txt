GAP. 1—3. 89

imperatorum non turribus, sed tropaeis, quae multis victoriis erat
jamdiu triumphisque pacata, sie a barbaris quibus est propter
avaritiam pax erepta vexatur, ut Thessalonicenses positi in gremio
imperii nostri relinquere oppidum et arcem munire cogantur3 ut
via illa nostra, quae per Macedoniam est usque ad Hellespontum
militaris, non solum excursionibus barbarorum sit infesta, sed etiam
eastris Thraciis distincta ac notata. Ita gentes eae, quae ut pace
uterentur vim argenti dederant praeclaro nostro imperatori, ut ex-
haustas domos replere possent pro empta pace bellum nobis prope
justum intulerunt.

III. Jam vero exereitus ille noster superbissimo delectu et
durissima conquisitione collectus omnis interiit. Magno hoe dico
cum dolore. Miserandum in modum milites populi Romani eapti,
necati, deserti, dissipati sunt, incuria, fame, morbo, vastitate con-
sumpti, ut, quod est indignissimum, scelus imperatoris in poenam
exercitus expetitum esse videatur. Atque hanc Macedoniam,
domitis jam gentibus finitimis barbariaque compressa pacatam ipsam

Thessalonicenses] Thessalonica was ori-
ginally named Therme, one of the chieftowns
in Macedonia at the head of the gulf of
Therme, on the slope of a hill, and the mo-
dern Saloniki. Thessalonica was on the Via

kind; a levying of men in which only the
best and choicest were taken. lIe gives an
example from Cicero in which he speaks of
the ‘judicium auriu'n ’ as being ‘ superbis-
simum ' when it is offended with the least
faults. But Ι think Abrami’s explanation
is right. He takes it to mean ‘ most sti-iet
and severe.’ Cicero says (In Pison. c. ΗΞ) :
“ Habebas exercitum tantum quantum tibi
non senatus aut populus Romanus dederat.

Egnatia. the road which ran from Dyrrha-
chium on the Hadriatic through Lychnidus,
Heraclea Lyncestis, Edessa, Thessalonica,
Amphipolis, and Philippi to Byzantium.
(Strabo, p. 322.) This was the great Roman

military road to the east, one of their great
works‚ which was made soon after the con-
quest of Macedonia, for it existed in Poly-
bius' time, who is Strabo's authority for
what he says about it. Strabo speaks only
of the road from Apollonia to the Hebrus,
the length of which was 535 M.1>.‚ all mea-
sured and marked with mile-stones. A
branch of this road began at Apollonia and
joined the road from Dyrrhachium.-

leraciis] ‘ Thraeciis‚’ Baiter. ‘ Infesta ’
in its passive sense, ¹infcsted,' which we
have borrowed (Pro Caelio, c. 4).—‘ ut
pace uterentur ι’ ‘that they might have
peace ;’ one of the many examples of the
use of ‘uti.' Caesar (Β. G. iii. 22) says
‘⁴ repulsus in oppidum tamen uti eadem
deditionis conditione uteretur ab Crasso im-
petravit.” This Thracian invasion of Mace-
donia was almost like a regular war (prope
justum), as he says.

3. delectu] ⁴ dilectu ' Baiter. The com-
mentators do not agree about the meaning
of ‘superbissima’ Manutius takes it to
mean ‘ most fastidious‚' or something of the

sed quantum tua libido conscripserat ;” and
again, c. 24 : “quum orbabas Italiam juven-
tute.”

vastitate] By being in desert places
where there was neither food nor shelter.
A passage in the In Pisonem, c. 35, mav be
compared with this ε “ tua scelera Dii ’im-
mortales in nostros milites expiaverunt.’'
The words ⁴ scelus . . . expetitum esse ’
are difficule to explain. G. E. have ⁴ expe-
titus esse‚' and Gulielmius proposed to read
¹ exercitus expetisse videatu1·‚' explaining
the use of ‘expetisse' by similar uses in
Plautus. Either this emendation must he
accepted or that of ‘ expiatum esse’ tbumlml

on the. passage in the In Pisonem, and men-
tioned bv Baiter.

barbaria] See Vol. iii. Index.— -¹ sine
imperio τ’ a legatus who held a province
‘ sine imperio.' The ¹ imperinm ’ was tho
authority given by the state to n proconsul
or propraetor. by virtue ot' which lu· exer-
cised unlimited authority civil and military.
as it is said by Cicero, Phil. v. 16. lt could
be given to a person below the rank ot' a
