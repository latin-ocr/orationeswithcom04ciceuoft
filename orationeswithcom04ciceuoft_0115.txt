ad laudem milites hortaretur, sed omnia sibi et empta et emenda
esse clamaret. V. J am vero publicanos miseros—me etiam
miserum illorum ita de me meritorum miseriis ae dolore,—tradidit
in servitutem J udaeis et Syris, nationibus natis servituti. Statuit
ab initio, et in eo perseveravit, jus publicano non dicere: pactiones
sine ulla injuria factas rescidit, custodias sustulit, vectigales multos
ac stipendiarios liberavit; quo in oppido ipse esset aut quo veniret,
ibi publicanum aut publicani servum esset vetuit. Quid multa?
crudelis haberetur, si in hostes animo fuisset eo quo fuit in cives
Romanos ejus ordinis praesertim, qui est semper dignitate sua,
benignitate magistratus sustentatus. Itaque, patres conscripti,
videtis non temeritate redemptionis aut negotii gerendi inscitia, sed
avaritia, superbia, erudelitate Gabinii paene afflictos jam atque
eversos publicanos ; quibus quidem vos in his angustiis aerarii tamen
subveniatis necesse est, etsi jam multis non potestis, qui propter
illum hostem senatus, inimicissimum ordinis equestris bonorumque
omnium, non solum bona, sed etiam honest-atem miseri deperdide-
runt; quos non parsimonia, non continentia, non virtus, non labor,
non splendor tueri potuit contra illius helluonis et praedonis auda-
ciam. * Quid, qui se etiarn nunc subsidiis patrimonii aut amicorum
liberalitate sustentant, hos perire patiemur? An si qui frui publico

5. publicanos miseros] They were of the
equestrian class, to whom Cicero belonged.
They supported him in his consulship and
in the time of his troubles with Clodius.
Cicero tells us vaguely what Gabinius didt
he did not favour the Publicani, or farmers
of the revenues 3 and he favour-ed the J udaei
and Syri in some way ; he relieved them of
some payments. Cicero charges Gabinius
with refusing the Publicani the legal means
of obtaining their dues (jus publicano non
dicere). He rescinded those agreements
(pactiones) between the tax payers and the
tax collectors which had been fairly made.
(Yerr. ii. 3, c. 47, note on Pactiones). The
words ⁸ custodias sustulit ' are supposed by
some eommentators to mean prisons3 and
so he foi-bade any debtor of the Publicani to
be imprisoned. The word has this mean-
ing in the Verrine orations. But in the
oration De Imp. Cn. Pompeii, c. 6, the
word ‘custodiae' has a different meaning.
Abrami has perhaps given the right expla-
nation : he ordered the small buildings (ca-
sulae, tou-houses) to be taken down, which

in the harbours for the convenience of the
slaves of the Publicani and their collectors.
Thus Matthew was sitting at the toll-
house (καθὴμειόν ἐπὶ τὸ τελώνιον) when
Jesus called him (Matth. ix. 9).

vectiqales] He released people from the
payment of vectigal and stipendium. See
Vol. i. Index, Vectigal, stipendiarii.

temeritate redemptionis] The Publicani
(of Syria, we must suppose, or those who
had farmed the revenues of Syria) were
nearly insolvent, not because they had
rashly given too much for their farm (re-
demptio), but through Gabinius’ behaviour
to them. Sometimes the Publicani did bid
too much, and wanted to have the bargain
undone (Ad Att. i. 17).—‘ in his angustiis
aerarii:' the aerarium had been exhaustcd,

and Caesar. Money had been given to
Caesar also for his Gallie war.
