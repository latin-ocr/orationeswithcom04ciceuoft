PRO Q. LIGARIO

ORATIO.

INTRODUCTION.

Q.L1GAR1US was the legatus of C. Considius the governor of Africa
before the commencement of the civil war. Considius quitted Africa at
the close of B.C. 50 or the beginning of the following year, leaving Q.
Ligarius in charge of the province (c. 1). When the war began by
Caesar crossing the Rubicon with his troops, the Pompeian party, which
was strong in Africa, pressed Ligarius to put himself at their head3 but
he refused (c. 1). In the mean time P. Attius Varus, a former governor
of Africa, who had fied to that province after being deserted by his
troops at Auximum in Picenum, gladly accepted the proposals of the
Provinciales of Africa, raised two legions there, and assumed the com-
mand (Caesar, B. C. i. 12 and 31). L. Aelius Tubero was now sent
with authority from the senate to take possession of the government of
Africa, but when 116 appeared before the harbour of Utica with his ships,
Varus would not allow him to enter the town, nor even to land his son
Quintus Tubero, who was sick, nor to take in water (Caesar, B. O. i.
313 Pomponius, Dig. i. 2. 2, ξ 46). Pomponius says that Q. Ligarius,
who had the care of the sea coast of the province, executed Varus' orders.
The father and son went 10 join Pompeius in Macedonia (6. 9), and
after his defeat they submitted to Caesar and were pardoned. Q. Li-
garius stayed in Africa, where the party of Pompeius after his death
made an obstinate resistance to Caesar. After the battle of Thapsus,
Ro. 46, in which the Pompeians of Africa were defeated, Caesar took
Q. Ligarius in Adrumetum together with C. Considius, the son of C. Con-
sidius, and 116 spared the lives of both (Bell. Afric. c. 89). P. Ligarius,
not a brother (6. 12), but probably some kinsman of Quintus, had been
taken on shipboard before the battle of Thapsus, and put to death by
Caesar’s order. Publius had fought under Afranius in Spain against
