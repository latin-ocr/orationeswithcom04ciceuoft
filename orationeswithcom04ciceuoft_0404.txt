382 PRO M. MARCELLO.

Wolf ’s time, and in many respects has gone back. If this great scholar
thought that Cicero would not make such a speech as this, it is a con-
clusion which many men of good judgment and taste will accept. That
he either spoke it or wrote it just as it is, I do not believe. That it con-
tains a good deal from Cicero’s hand, I also believe3 sor example, the‘
whole of the last chapter may be his. The conclusion is that Cicero’s
work was patched by some declamator. Wolf ’s remark, “ Quod saepe
hic videmus, non tam singula verba nobis reprehendenda quam universa
sententia et compositio,” is the judgment of a man of taste. It is the
whole which makes the impression. Wolf has found fault with some of
the ‘singula verba,’ and not always judiciously. Another critic says:
“From a misunderstanding of some passages in the ancient writers
which refer to this speech, and also from deficient skill in the critical
handling of the text, many persons since F. A. Wolf have declared this
speech to be spurious3 yet after the removal of the corruptions in the
text by the aid of criticism, with a right explanation of the extant autho-
rities, and a proper comprehension of the circumstances of the time, no
doubt will remain that this speech was written by Cicero exactly as we
have it3 that it is the best production of Cicero's genius, we would not
ourselves maintain” (Klotz). One might suppose from these remarks that
Klotz thought Wolf no better than a fool. The faults of the speech, whe-
ther it is Cicero’s 01· not, are of the same kind as those in the four spurious
orations, though this speech probably contains a much lai-ger proportion
of Cicero’s genuine language. There are no absolute rules by which
the genuineness of any work of art can be determined3 but when the
eye, the ear, the taste have been trained by the best examples, they may
form a correct judgment. In the arts, commonly called the fine arts,
there are generally some persons whose judgment in doubtful cases may
be accepted. In literature this is not so. On some few works there is
a unanimous opinion3 but on all others there may be difference of
opinion, and every man will have his own. So it must be with this
speech. Those who can read and admire it must be content with the
pleasure which they get, without complaining that others cannot
share it.
