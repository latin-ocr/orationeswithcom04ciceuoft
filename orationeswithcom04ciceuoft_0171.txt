CAP. 24-26, 149

sententiam et praetextam togam consequuntur. Et adoptio Theo-
phani agitata est, per quamv Cornelius nihil est praeterquam propin-
quorum suorum hereditates assecutus.

XXVI. Quamquam istorum animos, qui ipsi Cornelio invident,
non est difficillimum mitigare. More hominum invident, in eon-
viviis rodunt, in circulis vellicant; non illo inimico, sed hoc male-
dico dente carpunt. Qui amieis L. Cornelii aut inimici sunt
aut invident, ii sunt huic multo vehementius pertimescendi.
Nam huic quidem ipsi quis est umquam inventus inimicus,

aut quis jure esse potuit?

remarks that “some persons by way of
honour or reward, although they had not
obtained curule honores, were allowed to
speak among the consulares or praetorii, or
even the aedilitii.” The ⁴ praetexta toga ⁷ is
the dress of consuls, praetors, and curule
aediles (Cicero, Verr. ii. 5, c. 143 In Vatin.
c. 73 Pro Cluentio, c. 56) ; and here Cicero
speaks of men who obtained a praetorian
or senatorian rank and a ‘ p1·aetexta.‘ Manu-
tius says that when a magistratus after being
elected was convieted of ambitus, those who
had prosecuted him to conviction got his
place3 but there is no authority for this.

t Theophani] The adoption byTheophanes
of Mitylene. the favourite of Cn. Pompeius
Magnus (Pro Archia, c. 10). He adopted
Balbus. Capitolinus (Maximus et Bal-
binus, c. 7) speaking of Balbinus says,
“Familiae vetustissimae, ut ipse dicebat,
a Balbo Cornelio Theophane originem du-
cens, qui per Cn. Pompeium civitatem
meruerat, cum esset suae patriae nobilis-
simus, idemque historiae scriptor.'' Cicero
mentions this adoption in a letter to
Atticus (vii. 7, “adoptatum . . Gaditanum
a Mitylenaeo ”). Baiter has ‘adoptatio‚’
the reading of P. The form in Gaius is
⁴ adoptio!

propinquorum] ⁴ Balbus has got nothing
by this adoption except the hereditates of
his own propinqui.’ This is obscure.
Manutius supposes that Balbus gave all that
he got by this adoption to his own relations;
and so may be said to have got not his own
‘liereditas,' but the ‘hereditates’ of his
‘ propinqui ' Klotz does not accept Manu-
tius' absurd interpretation, and he proposes
another, which seems to assume that Theo-
phanes was dead. But he was alive when
this speech was delivered and long after,
and Balbus could not have got the ‘here-
ditas ’ of Theophanes by this adoption.
lf— Theophanes adopted Balbus, Balbus

Quem bonum non coluit? cujus
fortunae dignitatique non concessit?

Versatus in intima familiari-

became his son; and all Balbus' pro-
perty, for being ‘sui juris’ he might have
property, became the property of Theo-
phanes. This was the strict legal conse-
quence of Admgafio, though we may as-
sume that the Romans had some way of
eluding the law. Balbus had a Tusculanum,
as we have been told, and consequently pro-
perty of his own. Now when Cicero says
that Balbus has got nothing by the Adoptio,
it is difficult to see what he means, because
he could get nothing by Adoptio while his
adoptive father was alive. Theophanes
could make him a gift. But here Cicero
speaks as if something might have been got
by the adoption, and he says he has got
nothing except the ⁶ hereditates of his pro-
pinqui.’ His propinqui were Gaditani, for
he was a citizen of Gades by birth, of Rome
only by the favour of Pompeius. Ι do not
see how he got such ‘ hereditates ' through
or by adoption; and if he did get them,
they belonged to Theophanes according to
Roman law3 for what the son acquired was
acquired for the ffather. I cannot divine
what Cicero means.
215. rodunt]

“ Quem rodunt omnes libertino patre
natum.’'

(Horace, Sat. i. 6. v. 46,)—‘ in circulis ε’ ‘ in
common talk,’ whenever and wherever peo-
plc niet. The words ⁸ circuli ' and ¹ convivia'
go together, as in Livy (34, c. 61); aud
Cicero (Ad Att. ii. la) ε “ sermo in circulis
duntaxat et in conviviis est liberior quum
fuit.’'

cuius fortunae] IIe seems to mean,
‘XVhen did he not pay due respect to a
nian's good fortune and merit ?' it' ¹ ‹lig-
nitas ' means merit, as I hope that it does
for Cicero's sake, and not ⁴ rank ' or ¹ high
station,' as below. Balbus was a prudent
man, who was very respectsul to his supe-
