ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

praemia amplissima? quibus rebus omnium mortalium non voluntate
sed convicio repudiatis, fregerisne in earcere cervices ipsi illi Vettio,
ne quod indicium corrupti indicii exstaret ejusque sceleris in te

ipsum quaestio flagitaretur?

Et quoniam crebro usurpas legem te de alternis consiliis rejici-
endis tulisse, ut omnes intelligant te ne recte quidem facere sine
scelere potuisse, quaero, quum lex esset aequa promulgata initio

the same way by the Populus, as Abrami
suggests.

cervices] So this word is used In Verr.
ii. 5, c. 57 : “ cervices in carcere frangeban-
tur.'' Vettius was found dead in prison,
but nobody knew how it happened. (Ap-
pian, B. C. ii. 12.) Suetonius (Caesar, c.
20) says that it was believed that Caesar
had Vettius poisoned in prison. Even re-
ports, when they really have been reportS‚
are historical facts3 and if Suetonius tells
the truth, it is an historical fact that Caesar
was supposed to have poisoned the misera-
ble sellom But Suetonius' ⁴ creditur ’ may
be his own invention. Caesar being consul
might have the power to do this crime.
Appian says that Caesar charged those with
the crime whom Vettius had denounced.
Dion Cassius (38, c. 9) charges Cicero and
L. Lucullus with the conspiracy against
Pompeius’ life ς but Dion, as Casaubon says,

charges any illustrious man with any crime..

He is 3 vile calumniator and corrupter of
history. He may however have told the
truth here. Either Vettius killed himself,
and that is not said, or he was murdered.
If he was murdered, we have to fix the
murder on one side or the other, on Caesar
and his friend Vatinius, or on those whom
Vettius denounced. A guess is not worth
much in such a case, but if I were to make
one, I would fix the murder on Caesar ‘or
his mol Vatinius. Drumann (ii. 236) dis-
poses of the matter in a strange way:
“ Cicero accused Vatinius of having mur-
dered Vettius; if the assassins were hired
by him, it was done at Caesar's command,
whose object was topprevent the accused
from telling the truth through sear.” lf
the assassins were not hired by Vatinius;
what then ἓ He who could command access
to the prison, and he whose business it was
to investigate the murder must be suspected.
Caesar or the tribune, we must suppose,
could command access to the prison: and
Caesar could have investigated the matter.
All were glad when the wretch was disposed
of; and all were guilty in some way.
iudicium . . . indicii] Halm compares
Pro Sulla, c. 15: “ut ante quam me com-

mutati indicii coargueris, te summae negli-
gentiae tuo indicio convictum esse fateare.³’
But in his later edition of the oration Pro
Sulla, he writes ⁸ tuo iudicio,' and perhaps
correctly.

crebro usurpas] ⁴ You often say‚’ ‘ often
boast.’—‘ de alternis consiliis:' the ‘ con-
silia ' are all the ⁴ judices ' who were chosen
by the praetor for any one trial. By the
Lex Vatinia the accused (reus) in a trial for
Repetundae could reject or challenge all the
‘judices ' once, and the prosecutor (accusator)
could do the same; the previous practice
having been that each party, prosecutor
and defendant, could only challenge a cer-
tain number of the ‘consilium,' and the
places of those who were challenged were
supplied by the praetor’s ‘ subsortitio ' (see
Index, Subsortiri‚ Vol. i). This is Ernesti’s
explanation. C. T. Zumpt (Commentatt.
de Legibus judiciisque repetundarum in re
publ. Rom. Berol. 1845, quoted by Halm)
says that. this Lex Vatinia, enacted B.c. 59,
is called ‘ aequa ' by Cicero, that is favour-
able to the accused, whence we may con-
clude that it continued in force afterwards.
It appears from c. ll that this Lex applied
to the case of Repetundae, but it applied
also, as Zumpt conjectures, to other cases,
or was general. He rejects Ernesti’s ex-
planation of the ‘alterna consilia.' That,
he says, is ‘ alicujus consilium‚' which re-
mains after those have been challenged
whom the accusator or reus supposed to be
unlavourable to him3 as in the case of
Milo’s trial, when each party could reject
five out of each of the three classes of ju-
dices, senatores, equites, and tribuni aerarii;
and this was called Milo’s ⁴ consilium ’ after
he had challenged fifteen3 and also it was
called the prosecutor's ‘consilium' after he
had exercised his power of challenging
fifteen others. Accordingly (igitur) the Lex
Vatinia allowed either party to challenge the
‘consilia ⁷ once, and on this being done a
new ‘consilium ’ was appointed3 but it was
not allowed, as Ernesti supposed, for the
whole ‘ consilium ’ to be challenged twice,
first by the accused and then by the prose-
cutor.
