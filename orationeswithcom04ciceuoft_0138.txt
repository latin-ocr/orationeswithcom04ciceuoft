PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

ORATIO.

INTRODUOTION.

L. CORNELIUS BALnus was a native of Gades (Cadiz) in Hispania Ulte-
rior. The town of Gades, an old Phoenician colony and afterwards a
dependency on Carthage, is said to have first formed an alliance with
Rome in Rc. 212, through the influence of L. Marcius, after the death
of Cn. and P. Scipio in Spain (Livy, 25, c. 373 and 32, c. 23 Cicero,
Pro Balbo, c. 15). Asterwards in the consulate of M. Aemilius Lepidus
and Q. Lutatius Catulus (13.0. 78) 3 foedus was made with the Gaditani,
or the old foedus made by L. Marcius was renewed. Yet the foedus was
not confirmed by the Roman populus (Pro Balbo, c. 15).

During the war with Sertorius in Spain the Gaditani were on the
Roman side and aided the generals Q. Metellus Pius and Cn. Pompeius.
Ba1bus served on the Roman side, and was in the battles on the Sucro
and the Turia (Pro Balbo, c. 2). Pompeius with the approbation of his
Consilium gave the Roman civitas to Balbus and others ; and this gift
was confirmed by a Lex proposed by L. Gellius and Cn. Cornelius pur-
suant to a resolution of the senate (13.0. 72). When Balbus became a
Roman citizen, he took the name of L. Cornelius, it being usual for a
foreigner who obtained the civitas to assume also a Roman name, and
generally the name of his patron. Why he took the name of Cornelius,
or who was the Cornelius whose name he took, we do not know.

Though Pompeius was Balbus’ patron, he got the favour of Caesar
too3 and when Caesar was praetor in Spain (13.0, 62, 61), Balbus was
with him and received great marks of favour. He appears to have had
the office of ‘praefectus fabrum,’ or chief of the engineers, under Caesar in
Spain (Pro Balbo, c. 28). In no. 59 Caesar was consul. Balbus stuck
close to his great friend, but he assured Cicero that Caesar would follow
Cicero’s and Pompeins⁷ advice in all things, and would do all that he
