INTRODUOTION. 221

a sharp look out on its members to see that they gave their votes the
right way, so far as this could be known when the vote was by ballot.
Sigonius had a correct notion of the distinction between Ambitus and
the practices which the Lex Licinia de Sodaliciis was designed to pre-
vent and to punish. But he had a false notion, which ‘Wunder has
adopted, that the voters were either secured by bribery, or compelled to
vote for a candidate. Wunder's explanation of the ‘ vis ’ which he sup-
poses to have been used is this, which I give in his own words: “Vis
autem cernebatur in eo, quod certi quidam homines, sodales dicti, quos
candidati largitione corruperant, multitudinem cogebant, ut ei a. quo
erant corrupti honorem deferrent. Id quo facilius fieri posset, tribules a
candidato decuriabantur populusque describebatur, ita ut unicuique
sodalium certa pars tribus et populi adsignaretur, cujus ut suffragia candi-
datus ferret, quocunque modo efficere debebant” (Prolegomena, p. lxxiv).
According to this explanation the ‘ sodales ² were the managers of the
election, and each had his men whom he drove to the vote sor his em-
ployer. But this is not the way that such things are managed, for
though many of the Roman voters were poor and venal, any thing like
force could not be used to drive them to the polling place, where they
gave a vote by a tabella or ballot. There were, no doubt, many indirect
ways of influence, what our House of Commons calls undue infiuence,
and even of intimidation. Cicero tells us (Pro Plancio, c. 19) that
Plancius had gained great influence in his own tribe by the services
which he had rendered to many of the voters, and by the places of profit
which his father's interest and influence had procurcd for thcm; for
Plancius’ father belonged to the powerful company of the Publicani.
In Great Britain and Ireland, and in the United States, men who have
power will use it, if they can, to compel electors to vote as they wish.
If the voter is a workman of any kind, a shopkeeper‚ a clerk, or a tc-
nant3 if his interests are in any way under the control of men who wish
to command his vote, we know by experience that there are men vile
enough to abuse this power, and to compel the elector to vote as they
wish, and not as he wishes. So it was at Rome, and so it always will be
as long as there are eloctions. The practical problem is to deprive these
base men of their power3 and it was supposed at Rome, and is supposed
now, that the vote by ballot can do this to some extent. The Romans,
wo may assume, did not attempt to do by the ballot moro than can bc
done. They gave the voter in some way the power of votiug, so that uo-
body could tell how hc voted unless he told it hi1nself; and it may have
been for tho purpose of secui-ing the votor against intrusion on his
secrccy that Marius made tho approaches (pontes) to the polling phu-vs
narrower, and only fitted to receive a few persons at once. Sccrccy lo
