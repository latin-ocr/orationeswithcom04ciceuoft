et motu temeritatis modum aliquem et consilium et rationem re-
quiremus? Quare noli me ad contentionem vestrum vocare, Late-
rensis. Etenim si populo grata est tabella, quae frontes aperit
hominum, mentes tegit, datque eam libertatem ut quod velint faciant,
promittant autem quod rogentur, cur tu id in judicio exprimis,
quod non fit in campo? ‘ Hic quam ille dignior,' perquam grave est
dictu. Quomodo igitur est aequius? Sic credo: quod agitur,
quod sat-is est judici : ‘hic factus ests—Cur iste potius quam ego?
—Vel nescio, vel non dico, vel denique, quod mihi esset gravissi-
mum si dicerem, sed impune tamen deberem dicere : ⁶ Non recte?
Nam quid assequerer, si illa extrema defensione uterer, populum

quod voluisset fecisse, non quod debuisset?

VII. Quid, si populi quoque factum defendo, Laterensis, et doceo
On. Plancium non obrepsisse ad honorem, sed eo venisse cursu qui

iv. l, “ut locis frigidissimis neque vestitus
praeter pelles habeant quidquam.'’

Wunder remarks that one can hardly say
how often the preposition in has been
added by the ‘interpretes‚' even contrary
to Roman usage.

contentionem vestrum]
means comparison, as in c. 2.
mon reading is ‘vestram ;' but T. has
‘ vostrum‚' and the sense requires it. The
passage of Gellius also (xx. 6) proves
‘vestrum’ to be the true reading: “haec
autem ipsa ratio est in numero pluratiVO,
qua Gracchus misereri vestrum, et qua
M. Cicero contentio vestrum et contentione
nostrum dixit.’'

frontes aperit] Manutius thought this
worth a note, but nobody can mistake the
meaning. The difficulty is to keep the
metaphor in translation. Manutius how-
ever understood what an excellent thing
the ballot is: it enablcs a man to put on a
cheerful face, and to promise to do what he
will not do, because the ballot hides his
thoughts.

cnr tu id, &eff Baiter has ‘ cur tu id
in judicio ut fiat exprimis, quod non‚’ &c.
‘ Ut fiat' is in the Erfurt and the B. of
Wunder, but Ι think Wunder is right in
rejecting it. The meaning is this: ‘Why
do you, Laterensis, attempt to make the
J udices say that which is never said in tho
Campus Martius?' If the text is the true
reading. it is easy to sec that ‘ ut fiat’ may
have been added to make the two parts of
the sentence coi-respond, ‘ut fiat' aud
‘ fit ς’ for if the ‘ut tiat' is wanting, they
do not correspond, aud a litei-al translation
is impossible. ‘Exprimere' sometimes

⁴ Contentio '
The com-

signifies to draw something out of an un-
willing person, as in Cacsar, B. G. i. 32:
‘⁴ quum ab his saepe quaereret neque ullam
omnino vocem exprimere posset.'’ Cicero
also, in a letter to Atticus (ii. 21), has the
same expression as Caesar.

Hic quam ille] lle does not mean any
two candidates, but Plancius aud Laterensis
(VVundcr).-—⁴ quod agitu1·:' ‘the matter
which is in liand3’ ‘the thing that we are
talking about :' ‘worauf es hier ankommt,’
as Wunder translates it, who quotes Phil.
xi. 10: ‘⁶ nunc quod agitur agamus.'’ There
are numerous other examplcs, as in De
Prov.Cons. c. 4 : ‘⁸ de provincia. quod agitur,
id disputo.'' So the Romans said ⁸ lloc
age‚’ when they bade a man attend to the
business that was in hand.

quod milti esset yravissimum] ‘What
would damage my ease most3’ for if he
admitted that Plancius had not been pro-
perly preferred to Laterensis, it. might be
inserred that Plancius had been guilty ot'
bribcry.

Nam qnid assequerer] Baiter, following
others, writes ‘ num quid assequerercff E. T.
have ‘nunc quid.' Buiter’s text means:
‘Would you gain any thing, if Ι were to
avail mysclf of that conclusive auswer.
that the people had done as they liked,
not as they ought?’ But the meaning is
this: ‘For what should I get by simply
saying that they did as they liked ?' lt* ho
said so, he would be giving no anisum· at
all. Wunder observes that 'assequi-rere*
is contrary to all the MSS.. and ho 1¹0¹·-
rcctly explains the sentence, ⁸ Nam quid.'
&c. Cicero explains himself in the next
chapter.
