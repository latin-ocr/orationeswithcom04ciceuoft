ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

fratrisque filiam, non in familia, sed in ,carcere collocatam audire

maluit quam videre.

Xll. Et quoniam pecunias aliorum despicis, de tuis divitiis
intolerantis1225nm gloriaris, volo uti mihi respondeas, fecerisne foedera
tribunus plebis cum civitatibus, cum regibus, cum tetrarchis; ero-
garisne pecunias ex aerario tuis legibus? eripuerisne partes illo

tempore carissimas partim a Caesare, partim a publicanis?

Quae

quum ita sint, quaero ex te sisne ex pauperrimo dives factus illo
ipso anno, quo lex lata est de pecuniis repetundis acerrima3 ut
omnes intelligere possent, a te non modo nostra acta, quos tyrannos

carcere ’ is not quite plain. It is opposed
to ‘ in familia.' Some critics have supposed
that Cicero calls Vatinius ⁴ carcer ;’ but this
explanation will not explain the opposition
of ‘ familia' and ‘carcer,' and Halm con-
jectures that the ¹ carcer ' is a contemptnous
name for Vatinius' house, as Manutius had
said: ‘⁴ Cal-cerem appellat Vatinii domum
in quam Antoniorum imagines, ducta An-
tonia, Vatinius transtulit, ademptas fortasse
C. Antonio post damnationem.” Becker
(Rem. Alt. ii. l, p. 231, n. 472) infers
from this passage that ⁴ Affines ’ were
reckoned in a Familia, since in consequence
of a marriage the majores of the woman
were added to those of the man, and their
Imagines also set up. But what Cicero says
is hardly sufficient in itself to justify this
conclusion.

12. foedera] Goveanus observes that
the Populus Romanus made ‘foedera‚’ or
confirmed ‘ foedera’ made by an ‘imperator'
or the Senate3 and that a Tribunus did not
make ‘foedera’ But Cicero means bar-
gains, and bargains made through the in-
strumentality of Vatinius in Caesar’s con-
sulship. The result of these bargains was
certain ⁴ rogationes! Suetonius (c. 54) says
ofCaesar in his consulship: “ In primo con-
sulatu tria millia pondo auri furatus e Capi-
tolio tantundem inaurati aeris reposuit. So-
cietates ac regna pretio dedit, ut qui uni
Ptolemaeo prope sex millia talentorum suo
Pompeiique nomine abstulerit.'' Cicero
charges Vatinius with doing what Suetonius
says that Caesar did. Vatinius was Caesar's
tool; and Cicero dishonestly imputes some
of Caesar's acts to the man whom Caesar
employed. The theft of the Capitoline gold
was a most scandalous affair, but we may
without difficulty disbelieve the story. Such
an act would have been soon detected.

cum reyibus] See Cicero’s letter to Len-
tulus (Ad Div. i. 9), and Ad Atticum (ii.
9). Among these kings was Ptolemaeus
Auletes, king of Egypt (Ad Attic. ii. 16;

Pro Sestio, c. 26) ; and Ariovistus, king of
the German tribes, who had got possession
of part of the country of the Sequani in
Gallia. Caesar (B. G. i. 35) says that Ario-
vistus received from the Roman Senate the
title of ‘ Rex ' and ‘ Amicus' in his consul-
ship (ac. 59), and Dion Cassius (38, e. 34)
says the same, following either Caesar or
some other authority. It is not probable
that Caesar got any money out of the Ger-
man king for the name that he gave him.
More probably Caesar gave the German
something to keep him quiet, till he had
time to come and drive him back over the
Rhine ς which he did the next year.

partes . . . carissimas] This is obscure;
and if it is the genuine text, we must be
content not to understand it. The only at-
tempt at explanation worth notice is Orelli’s,
but we want historical evidence to support
it. Halm concludes that Orelli is at least
so far right in interpreting ‘partes' to be
‘ partes publicorum,' ‘ partes ' of the ⁴ vec-
tigalia,' which the Publicani farmed; and he
refers to Pro Rabirio Post. c. 2; and to
Valerius Maximus vi. 9.. 7. Orelli takes
⁴ partes ' to be shares (the French, ‘actions 3'
the Italian, ¹ azioni ²), and these shares would
be higher at some times than at others.
The general meaning of Cicero's charge is
that Vatinius cheated Caesar and the Publi-
cani; and that is all that we can conclude.

de pecuniis rep] Caesar’s Lex de
Repetundis. the terms of which were very
strict. It appears from a passage in Cicero
(Ad Div. viii. 8) in a letter from Μ. Caelius
to Cicero that it contained at least 101
chapters (legisque unum et centesimum
caput legit). See Rein‚ Das Criminalrecht
der Riimer, p. 625, on this Lex Julia.

The ‘ nostra acta ' are not the Lex de Am-
bitu passed in Cicero's consulate, but his
measures against Catilina and his‘crew, as
Hermann suggests; and the words ‘quos
tyrannos vocas ' make this a probable ex-
planation.
