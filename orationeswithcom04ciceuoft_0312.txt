290 PRO G. RABIRIO POSTUMO.

this matter is discusscd in Cicero's lettersto Lentulus (Ad Div. Lib. i..)
Finally, the religious objection prevailed in the senate, and it was re· 1
solved to do nothing in this affair of Ptolemaeus. Ptolemaeus had left l
Rome for Ephesus about the end of nc. 57, with the expectation of
being restored by Lentulus, But help came from another quartcr.

A. Gabinius, one of the consuls of Bc. 58, had got Syria for his pro-
vince. He was a tool of Pompeius, who had resolved on settling Ptole·-
maeus’ business in a short way. There is no doubt that Gabinius acted
under his orders Gabinius agreed with Ptolemaeus to restore him for
ten thousand talents Accordingly he took the king back to Egypt, and
by force put the worthless fellow again on his throne (Bc. 55). = Ptole-
maeus had difficulty in paying the money, and we learn from this oration
that Rabirius was appointed to collect his revenues, and, as we may
infer, to pay Gabinius and himself too (Pro Rabirio, c. 10).

Gabinius had misconducted himself in his province, but the restora-
tion of the king without the authority of the senate was an act of
treason. ’

Before his return Cicero had done all that he could to give Gabinius
a bad name. He charged him with gross maladministration in his pro-
vince, and loaded him with the foulest abuse (In Pison.). On his re-
turn (Bc. 54) Gabinius stole into the city by night. Three prosecutions
awaited him. He was first tried on the charge of Majestas or treason,
for going out of his province to make war3 but he was aequit-ted by a
small majority (Ad Q. Fr. iii. 4), and in part through the influence of
Pompeius, The trial De Ambitu does not concern us here. The third
prosecution was for Repetundae. The prosecutor was C. Memmius
with L. Capito. Gabinius was charged with receiving the ten thousand
talents from Ptolemaeus and with getting money in his own province
by unfair means. Pompeius, who had always been a friend of Gabinius,
did not desert him in his difficulties, and he urged Cicero to be recon—
ciled to Gabinius. Cicero says in a letter to his brother (Ad Q. Fr. iii.
1. 5), “Pompeius has yet made no progress, nor will he, if I shall retain
anything of my liberty.’' But he had lost his liberty when he came back
from exile with the consent and aid of Pompeius, and to his great dis-
grace he dared not refuse to defend the man who in his own judgment
deserved the severest punishment. Caesar, though engaged in his second
British campaign, wrote to Rome in favour of Gabinius. We do not
know why such a knave should have been worthy of Caesar’s particular
protection3 but we may assume that Caesar had some good reasons for
what he did, and that he acted with an eye to his own interest. Gabinius
was convicted and went into exile, from which his friend Caesar recalled
him in B.O. 49. Cicero still hated and despised the man (Ad Att. x.

8, ἓ 3).
