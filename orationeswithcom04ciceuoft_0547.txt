Lenes alias] He abolished some of Cae-
sar’s Leges by new Leges, which were never
even promulgated (Phil. i. c. 10). He pro-
mulgated some Leges in order to abrogate
(tolleret) others. There is a reading ⁴ ut
tolleret promulgatas promulgavit,’ which is
in some editions, but some of the early crities
(Faernus, Muretus, and others) omitted
‘ promulgatas‚’ on the authority of the Co-
dex Vaticanus, and properly omitted it.
Graevius defends ‘ promulgatas.'

Testamentum] Caesar’s ‘ testamentum‚'
which Antonius made of no effect. ‘ Tes-
tamentum irritum ' is a technical term
(Gaius, ii. 146), which means that a will is
duly made, but loses its legal effect in con-
sequence of something which happens after-
wards, as if the testator sustained a Capitis
diminutio, or if there was no Heres to
take under the will. Cicero says ‘irritum
fecit? Antonius did not. allow the will to
take effect. He took possession of the tes-
tator’s property contrary to law.

Caesar left statues and pietures to the
Roman people. He left his ‘ horti’ then
‘instructi,' or ‘ cum instrumento ' (Index,
Vol. i. ‘ Instrumentum ’). Suetonius, who
speaks of the legacy of the ‘ horti! does not
mention the pictures and statues (Caesar,
c. 133). They were. intended to be puhlic
property for the pleasure and instruction of
the people. The ‘horti ⁹ contained build-
ings in which were statues and pietureS.
Antonius carried the things off, some to
Pompeius' ⁴ horti,' which hc had got. posses-
sion of (c. 27), and others to Scipio's villa

(e. 17). If all this is true, Antonius was
the most impudent knave on record.

43. pulvinar] The statues of the gods
were placed on ⁴ pulvinaria ’ during a ‘ lecti-
sternium.' Manutius refers to Suetonius
(Julius, c. 76): “Sed et ampliora etiam
humano fastigio decerni sibi passus est,
sedem auream in curia et pro tribunali, ten-
sam et ferculum Circensi pompa, templa,
aras, simulacra juxta deos, pulvinar, flami-
nem, Lupercos, appellationem mensis e suo
nomine.'’ “Fastigiumin domo,’' says Florus
(iv. 2), “suggestus in curia, fastigium in
domo, mensis in caelo.” The ⁴ fastigium ’
is ‘tectum fastigiatuin,' a front with a pedi-
ment, such as temples had. It is the Greek
ἀετός, ‹iii-wita. Caesar lived iu a Tem-
plum. He was a god. (l‘lut. Caesar, c. 63.)

flamen] See 1ntro‹1.—⁴inaugurare? ‘ in-
auguraris,' Halm. ⁴ Why are you not. in-
augurated, ordained ?’ The Pontifex Max-
imus named the Flamen (⁴¹ capit flaminem,
prodit,” Cic. Pro Mil. c. 10), who was 01·-
daiued in the Comitia Calata by an augur.
‘¹ In libro Laelii Felicis ad Q. Mucium

titicum habentur aut Regis aut Flaminum
inaugurandorum caussa! '’ (Gellius, xv. 27.)
