INTRODUOTION TO THE SIXTH PHILIPPIO.

THIS address to the people was delivered 011 1116 4111 of J anuary, B.c. 43.
Cicero's proposal made in the Fifth Philippic to declare Antonius an
enemy was not accepted by the senate3 but it was decreed: That a
statue should be erected in honour of Caesar, that he should be a senator
with the rank of quaestor, and that- he might be a candidate for the
other magistracies ten years before the usual time, and that he should
be repaid out of the Aerarium 1116 money which he had given to his sol-
diers, because, though he had enlisted thern himself, he had done it on
behalf of the state; that both these soldiers and those who had desei-ted
from Antonius should be free from serving in any other war, and that
lands should immediately be granted 10 1116111. They also sent ambas-

and mother with his young son had gone round to the principa] senators
10 5011611 for Antonius; and 011 1116 morning of the 4111 they presented
themselves in black to the senators as they were going to the senate,
and endeavoured to move their compassion. On this day Cicero spoke
again in the senate, and again urged that Antonius should be declarvd
an enemy. Piso spokc against Cicero’s motion, and prevailcd 011 tho
senate to reject it (Appiani, B. C. iii. c. 61). The senate votvd that
