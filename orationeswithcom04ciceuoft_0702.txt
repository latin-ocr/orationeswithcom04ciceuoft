anni vertentis] Trebonius was murdered
in February B.c. 43. Antonius does not
mean at the end of B.c. 44, 35 some critics
have supposed. Censorinus indeed (c. 19)
explains ⁴ annus vertens ’ thus: “Annus
vertens est natura dum sol percurrens ΧΠ
signa eodem unde profectus est redit '⁷ (see
also Macrobius, Sat. i. c. 14); and we must
admit that this is the proper sense of ⁴ annus
vertens.' These who refer Antonius’ words
to the year 13.c. 44, rely on what Cicero says
in Phil. xi. c. 13, that Dolabella, after Tre-
bonius' death, sent A. Allienus to Egypt to
bring four legions, and that Allienus gave
the legions up to Cassius before the 7th of
March B.c. 43 (Ad Div. xii. 11); which
cannot be comprehended, it is said, if Tre-
bonius had not been murdered in Β 6. 44.
But, on the other hand, it is replied that
Allienus might have reached Egypt quickly
by sea, and we know that when he left
Egypt with his legions for Syria, Cassius
met him on the way in Judaea; and all this
would not require months, but only weeks.
It is also possible that Cicero might not
accurately know the time when Allienus
left Asia for Egypt. There is also other
evidence in favour of Trebonius having been
murdered after B.c. 44. Cicero’s letter to
Trebonius (Ad Div. x. 28) was written after
the xm Kal. Jan.‚ on which day he deli-
vered his Third Philippic, and some time
after that day, also after the news of the

11) on the Nonae Martiae B.c. 43, 116 spoke
of Allienus, who had led the four legions
out of Egypt, but he said nothing of Trebo-
nius’ death. In his letter to Cicero dated
on the Nones of May, two months later,
he does speak of Trebonius' death (Ad Div.
xii. 12). Dolabella also, who went to Asia
through Macedonia and Thrace, had not
reached Asia in the month of December
B.c. 44 (Dion 47, c. 29), and he was on good
terms with Trebonius for some time after
his arrival in Asia. Finally, Dolabella was
not declared an enemy to the state at Rome
before the middle of March 13.c. 43; and
we may assume that the news of Trebonius'
death would be carried to Rome in a month.

This is Drumann’s remark (Geschichte
Roms, ii. p. 575, note 71). He has proved
that Trebonius was not killed in B.c. 44;
but still ‘ annus vertens ' may have its usual
sense. Antonius may have been ill in-
formed about the time of Trebonius’ mur-
der. Drumann does not say any thing
about the passage in Appian (B. C. iii. 61),
in which, after speaking of Cicero being
allowed to draw up the instructions for the
commissioners who were to be sent to An-
tonius (Introd. to Phil. vi. p. 584), Appian
adds: ‘ And the remains of Trebonius also
having just been brought (to Rome), and
the shameful treatment of Trebonius having
been more particularly known, the senate
without hesitation declared Dolabella to be
an enemy to the state) In the next chapter
(e. 62) Appian speaks of the commissioners
