OAP. 13, 14. 27

certe jam tibi dicere non licebit cum clarissimi viri caussa tuam
esse conjunctam—postulatusne sis lege Licinia et J unia? edixeritne
G. Memmius praetor ex ea lege ut adesses die tricesimo? quum is
dies venisset, fecerisne, quod in hac re publica non modo factum
antea numquam, sed in omni memoria est omnino inauditum,
appellarisne tribunos pl. ne causam diceres? levius dixi, quamquam
id ipsum esset et novum et non ferendum: sed appellarisne nomi—
natim pestem illius anni, furiam patriae, tempestatem rei publicae,
Clodium? qui tamen quum jure, quum more, quum potestate judi-
cium impedire non posset, rediit ad illam vim et furorem suum,
ducemque se militibus tuis praebuit. In quo, ne quid a me dictum
in te potius putes quam abs te esse quaesitum, nullum onus imponam
mihi testimonii: quae mihi brevi tempore ex eodem isto loco video
esse dicenda, servabo, teque non arguam, sed ut in ceteris rebus
feci rogabo. Quaero ex te, Vatini, num quis in hac civitate post
urbem conditam tribunos pl. appellarit, ne caussam diceret? num
quis reus in tribunal sui quaesitoris escenderit eumque vi deturbarit,

de quo puniendo iis legibus cavebatur.” But
116 has confounded this Lex with the Licinia
de Sodalitiis, as Mommsen has shown (see
the Introduction).

C. Memmius Gemellus was an enemy of
Caesar. and afterwards being condemned De
Ambitu he went to Athens. Three ofCicero’s
letters to him are extant (Ad Fam. xiii. 1, 2,
3). Lucretius dedicated his poem to this
master of Greek literature, who cared little
for the literature of his own nation (Cicero,
Brutus, c. 70). Memmius gave Vatinius
notice of trial (ut adesset).

numquam, sed] ⁴ nunquam est, sed ⁹ P. G.
The critics do not agree if we should have
‘ memoria sit ’ or ‘ memoria est! There is
no reason why Cicero could not make the
direct negation⁷ and that requires ⁴ est.y If
‘sit' is right, it means ⁴ such a thing as was
never heard of:' but it seems better to sup-
pose that he would say, ‘ a thing never
before heard of.'

appellarisne tribunos pL] The collegium
of tribuni was sometimes appealed to, as we
sec in the Pro Quintio, c. 73 and Pro M.
Tullio, § 38. We cannot infer that Va-
tinius had no right to appenl to the tribuni
pl.: for how could he attempt to do it, isit
was altogether illegal? Cicero, it is true,
says that it had never been done: in such
a cnse as this, wc must suppose.

levius diri] llalm compares Pro Sestio,
c. 69, “ ut levissime dicam.” llere he say&
¹ levius dixi,’ ‘ 1 have not expressed it
strongly 61111111ςὶιῖ-ι abs te esse quaesitum :’

he only asks, he does not assert, for asser-
tion would be nothing without evidence.
He questions him as a patronus. lle
threatens Vatinius with 8 future trial (see
6. 4), when he would give evidence against
him. But Cicero did not give evidence
against him. He even undertook Vatinius’
defence (B.c. 54) (Drumann, Gesehiehte
Roms, vi. 34), when he was prosecuted
under the Lex De Sodalitiis. Cicero was
compelled by circumstances to defend the
man whom he had so foully abused.

sui quaesitoris] This is the ‘Judex quaes-
tionis' who presided at the trial. The
8611 ›liast has a story that when the praetor
C. Memmius was appointiog the quaesitor
(sortito) to try Vatinius De vi. and Vatinius
and the prosecutor were claiming severally
their right to challenge the quaesitores,
some meu, at the instigation of vatinius, got
up on the tribunal, and seized the urus in
which the ¹ sortes’ were. The Scholiast's
remark about the ‘quaesitor' and ¹ quae-
sitores ’ is difficult to explain ς for it appears
from Cicero that the praetor C. Memmius
acted as the ‘quaesitor ' or ‘judex quaes-
tionis,' and therefore no other ⁸ quaesitor '
would be wanted. W'e cannot explain this
by supposing that the Scholiust nwnut
‘ju‹lices,' when he says ‘qtuwsitores.' for
116 tells us in the next scholium. on ¹ .1 udices
quaestionum ' that ‘quaesitores ’ und ·ju-
dices quaestionum ' are the suune (eosdem.
