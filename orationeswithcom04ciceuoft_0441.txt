OAP. 11, 12. 419

Sed parum est me hoc meminisse; spero etiam te, qui oblivisci
nihil soles nisi injurias, quoniam hoc est animi, quoniam etiam
ingenii tui, te aliquid de hujus illo quaestorio officio [cogitantem]
etiam de aliis quibusdam quaestoribus reminiscentem recordari.
Hic igitur T. Ligarius, qui tum nihil egit aliud, neque enim haec
divinabat, nisi ut eum tui studiosum et bonum virum judicares, nunc
a te supplex fratris salutem petit. Quam hujus admonitus officio
quum utrisque his dederis„ tres fratres optimos et integerrimos non
solum sibi ipsos neque his tot [ac] talibus viris neque nobis necessariis
tuis, sed etiam rei publicae condonaveris. Fac igitur, quod de ho-
mine nobilissimo et clarissimo [M. Marcello] fecisti nuper in curia,
nunc idem in foro de optimis et huic omni frequentiae probatissimis
fratribus. Ut concessisti illum senatui, sic da hunc populo, cujus
voluntatem carissimam semper habuisti; et si ille dies tibi glo-
riosissimus, [et] populo Romano gratissimus fuit, noli, obsecro, du-
bitare, O. Caesar, similem illi gloriae laudem quam saepissime quae-
rere. Nihil est [enim] tam populare quam bonitas, nulla de virtuti-
bus tuis plurimis nec admirabilior nec gratior misericordia est.
Homines enim ad deos nulla- re propius accedunt quam salutem
hominibus dando. Nihil habet nec fortuna tua majus quam ut

counts of what came in and went out. no other way of rewarding them, he chose

Ligarius we must suppose served Caesar on
this occasion as well as he could.

animi . . . inqenii] ‘ your disposition,
and your judgment.' ‘ Ingenium ' is ‘ sapi-
entia.’-——‘ oblivisci . . . nisi injurias ε’ Quin-
tilian (vi. 3. 108) has “ qui nihil soles obli-
visci nisi injurias.'' This was true, though
it was flattery. Caesar was forgiving to-
wards the Romans, Cicero among the rest;
and he lost his life for it. Cicero forgot no
wrong, not even an imaginary wrong or a
slight. These and many other passages are
his moral condemnation, for he fawned on
and flattercd the man in whose murder 118
rejoiced. The evidence against Cicero is his
own confession, and his friend Atticus has
helped to preserve it.

[coqitantem]] This word should per-
haps be omitted, and Halm and Baiter have
omitted it. The ‘ other quaestors ' have
been supposed to be those who resisted
Caesar, as for instance in ac. 49, when he
broke open the ‘sanctius aerarium! Halm
thinks that Cicero means to say that Caesar
had not forgotten to reward the services of
other quaestors. Dion Cassius (43, c. 47)
says that Caesar in ac. 45 named fourteen
praetors and forty quaestors, because he
had promised much to many, and having

this. But this is not the true explanation.
Cicero is speaking of men who did some-
thing when they were quaestors, and some-
thing which Caesar did not like3 whatever
it was.

eum lui]
“ Ex Cratandri libro legendum censeo
‘ nisi ut eum tui studiosum’ ” (Fabritius).
Various editors have seen that ‘tu’ was
wrong. Baiter has ‘tui eum.’

utrisque Itis] The two brothers on one
side, and Q. Ligarius on the other, for
whom they are entreating.

necessariis luis] For ⁸ tuis ’ some editions
have ‘suis.’ Madvig proposes to omit
⁸tuis,' as some MSS. do. But Halm re-
marks that if the ‘necessarii’ of Ligarius
are meant, the word ‘ejus’ is wanting;
and he sees no reason why Cicero should
not take the liberty of calling himself one
of the ‘ necessarii’ of Caesar.

[M. Marcello]] These words are omitted
in some MSS„ and it would be better
taste to omit the name. This is the con-
sul of n.c. 51. See the speech Pro Mar-
cello,

salutem hominibus] ‘ Salus’ is a word
that we find a difficulty in rendering by a
single term. 'We must look to the ad-

‘ eum tuis’ C.‚ ¹ tu eum ’ G.
