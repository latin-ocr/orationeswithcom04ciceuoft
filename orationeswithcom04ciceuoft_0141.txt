M. TULLII CICERONIS

PRO

L. CORNELIO BALBO ORATIO

AD JUDIOES.

I. Si auctoritates patronorum in judiciis valerent, ab amplissimis
viris L. Cornelii caussa defensa est; si usus, a peritissimis3 si
ingenia, ab eloquentissimis3 si studia, ab amicissimis et quum bene-
fieiis eum L. Cornelio, tum maxima familiaritate conjunctis. Quae
sunt igitur meae partes? Auctoritatis tantae quantam vos in me
esse voluistis, usus mediocris, ingenii minime voluntati paris. Nam
ceteris a quibus est defensus hune debere plurimum video: ego
quantum ei debeam, alio loeo. Principio orationis hoe oppono,
me omnibus, qui amici fuerint saluti et dignitati meae, si minus
referenda gratia satisfacere potuerim, praedicanda et habenda
certe satis esse facturum. Quae fuerit hesterno die Cn. Pompeii
