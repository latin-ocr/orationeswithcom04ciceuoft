was not rightly constituted. He did not,
says Cicero, follow the ⁴ sententia legis‚'
the meaning of the Lex ; but if he had not,
Plancius could not have been tried. The
‘ sententia legis’ is merely the opinion ex-
pressed by the Senate when they made the
Sctum previous to the enacting of the Lex
(quam in decernendo secuti sumus); and
this, as Ι have observed, had nothing to do
with Laterensis’ choice. Again Cicero says
‘ de civitate,’ as if Laterensis had selected
the Judices. WVunder observes that this
is properly said, because the prosecutor
named four ‘tribus,' and after one of them
had been rejected by the defendant, selected
the Judices from the three. But there is
no proof that he selected the J udices. Er-
nesti connected ‘spem aliquam’ with ‘de
civitate,’ which, as Wunder observes, is
wron .

digitalis quin] Cicero now concludes
that by not choosing the ‘ tribus ’ with which
Plancius was most closely connected, La-
terensis admitted that these ‘ tribus ' had not
been bribed3 and he enforces this by
adding, ‘For what can you allege against
this selection being considered most un-
favourable to the defendant, if no regard
has been paid to the reasons which moved
the Senate when they made the Sctum ?’
Ι have followed Wunder, who writes
‘potes,’ though all the MSS. have ‘po-
test.⁷

Itis a little difficult to follow the argu-
ment. The ‘ editio ’ of the Judices by the
prosecutor was in any case a hard thing for
a defendant (acerbum omnino genus), even
if the prosecutor named the defendant’s
own ⁴ tribus,’ or any ¹ tribus ’ with which 110
was most closely connected. But it would
be the greatest hardship to the defendant
(summa acerbitas), if the prosecutor paid
no respect to the meaning of the Senate
when they made the Sctum, if he did not
name the ¹ tribus ' which he declarcd to have
been corrupted by the defendant. Ac-
cordingly we must conclude, Cicero means,
either that Laterensis was guilty of this cx-
treme severity, when he did not name the

Terentina and the Voltinia; or if he was
not, we must assume that- he did not believe
that the Terentina and Voltinia had been
corrupted by Plancius.

Cicero's argument would be good for no-
thing if he had not founded it on the inten-
tion of the Senate when the Sctum was
made. For if Laterensis could name any
four ‘ tribus,' there was nothingto say against
him. If he did not name the two ‘ tribus '
which he had declared to be corrupted, he
only did what any prudent prosecutor would
have done; and he chose those‘tribus’ which
he considered either impartial or favourable
to himself. It might also be replied that if
Laterensis by not choosing the Terentina
and Voltinia had declared that they were
not bribed, he had eomplied with the mean-
ing of the Senate3 and as he had 01105011
other ‘tribus,' it might be said that we must
conclude that 110 supposed that these ‘ tribus’
were bribed; and so here also he had com-
plied with the meaning of the senate. But
Cicero has anticipated this, for he tells us
that Laterensis had said that. the Terentina
and the Voltinia were bribed, and the
prosecutor therefore could not escape froin
Cicero’s conclusion, except by denying his
premises. If these two ‘tribus ’ were not
bribed, though they were charged with
being bribed, the Jildices, if they had been
selected from them, might for this reason
have been favourable to Plancius, and so
Cicero might argue that Laterensis had
done the defendant a great wrong in not
choosing these tribes. XVhether they were
bribed or not, Cicero would not have ob-
jected to these tribes being chosen, foi·
Plancius was most intimately connected
with them, and had many friends in them.

This is a good deal to say on this unctior:
but the thing is not so easy ns it. may np-
pear. Cicero seems to 1110 to hare prc-
pared the way for a conclusion thnt cannot
be evaded, but the t'allacy lies in the pre-
vious chapter. The ancient. 01111111»- ex-
