GAP. 22, 23. 71

raudo devincta auctoritas ; ut res minime dubitanda in contentione
ponatur, utrum temeraria, procax, irata mulier finxisse crimen, an
gravis, sapiens moderatusque vir religiose testimonium dixisse
videatur.

XXIII. Reliquum est igitur crimen de veneno, cujus ego neque
principium invenire neque evolvere exitum possum. Quae fuit enim
caussa quamobrem isti mulieri venenum vellet dare Caelius? Ne
aurum redderet? num petivit? Ne crimen haereret? num quis
objecit? num quis denique fecisset mentionem, si hic nullius nomen
detulisset? Quin etiam Herennium dicere audistis, verbo se
molestum non futurum fuisse Caelio, nisi iterum eadem de re suo
familiari absoluto nomen hic detulisset. Credibile est igitur tantum
facinus ob nullam caussam esse commissum? et vos non videtis
fingi sceleris maximi crimen, ut alterius caussa sceleris suscipiendi
fuisse videatur? Cui denique commisit? quo adjutore usus est?
quo socio? quo conscio? cui tantum facinus, cui se, cui salutem
suam credidit? Servisne mulieris? sic enim objectum est. Et
erat tam demens hic, cui vos ingenium certe tribuitis, etiamsi cetera
inimica oratione detrahitis, ut omnes suas fortunas alienis servis
committeret? At quibus servis? refert enim magno opere id
ipsum; iisne quos intelligebat non communi conditione servitutis
uti, sed licentius, liberius, familiarius cum domina vivere? Quis
enim hoc non videt, judices, aut quis ignorat, in ejusmodi
domo, in qua materfamilias meretricio more vivat, in qua nihil

23. Quae fuit enim caussa] In a ‘res
conjecturalis,’ when there is not sufficient
evidence to prove a fact, we ask what could
be the man's motive for committing a crime
with which he is charged; for people do
not commit a crime without a ‘caussa‚'
without something which moves them to it.
See Pro Sex. Roscio Amerino, c. 30, the
passage ‘⁴ Sic vita hominum est.”

num petivit] Did Clodia ask for the
restoration of the ¹ aurum ?’ If she did not,
the ‘aurum' could be no motive to the
crime.-—‘ ne crimen haereret ?' ‘ was it lest
the charge or a charge should be fixed on
him ?' So Terence says ‘⁴ in te omnis haeret
culpa sola.'’ But what crimen does Cicero
mean? Feri-atius says it is the charge of
having procured Dion’s assmsination, for
which it was alleged (c. 21) that Caelius
got the gold from Clodia. Caclius is charged
with attcmpting to poison Clodia. Well,
says Cicero, what was his motive? Was it
to avoid repayment? lt was not. Was it
to avoid the charge of procuring Dion's
assassination? Why, that charge was never

heard of till Caelius prosecuted Atratinus.

nullius] T„ the true reading: ⁴ ncmini,’
codd. rell. (Halm). Pantagathus proposed
⁴ neminis,’ which shows that he understood
Cicero. The words ‘nisi . . . nomen hic
detulisset’ show what is meant.

alterius caussa] S. ‘ causa’ om. P. E. G.
Halm writes ‘ cansa alterius! They invent
the charge of an attempt to poison Clodia
(sceleris maximi crimen), that there may
seem to be a ¹ caussa' for the other crime, for
keeping the money. So Manutius explains it.
But that is not the meaning. Cicero has just
said that it is not credible that Caelius without
a motive planned so great a crime as poison-
ing Clodia. In order to suggest a motivo
for this crime (alterius caussa sceleris) they
invent ⁴ sceleris maximi crimen.' a story
about Caclius attempting to poison Dion.
and borrowing gold from Clodia for that
purpose: Clodiu, as the prosecutura say.
not knowing for what purpose the gold was
borrowed, but having discovered it uster-
wards, as it is implied in the charge.
