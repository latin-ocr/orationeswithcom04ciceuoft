156 ORAT. IN L. CALPURNIUM PISONEM.

had helped to bring about Cicero’s recall from exile : Caesar had been
consulted about it and had consented, and we may certainly conclude
that Cicero had either agreed to support Caesar's interests; or, if he had
not in terms made such a bargain, his brother had done it for him, and
his obligations to Caesar's son-in-law and others 111 the matter of his
recall made it impossible for him to oppose Caesar and his friends. The
speech on the consular provinces is the best proof of Cicero's humilia-
tion and of a change in his policy, but not in his opinions. Cicero tells
us in this speech what he did after his return to Rome in September
Rc. 57 and the arrival of Caesar’s despatches from Gallia. He voted
for and probably even proposed the extraordinary ‘supplicatio ³ for the
victories of Caesar in the country of the Belgae (De Prov. Cons. c. 11).
He was fresh from exile, timid, perhaps grateful to Pompeius and to
Caesar, and disposed to keep his promise to be quiet. But in the next
year (13.9. 56) 119 had got more courage. On the fifth of April 119 made
a motion in the senate (De Prov. Cous. c. 19) and carried it, that on the
fifteenth of May they should consider Caesar’s Campanian Lex in a full
senate. “ Could I,’' says he in a letter to Lentulus, “ make a more direct
attack on the stronghold of that party, or any way else more completely
show that I had forgotten my dangers and thought of the times when I
was active in the state P ” Certainly not. But the Ides of May came
and nothing was done about the Campanian land, that measure of Cae-
sar's which Cicero wished most earnestly to undo. In the mean time
something happened.

In the spring of Bc. 56 and in the month of April Caesar was at Luca
in North Italy, the southern limit of his province, and Pompeius
and M. Crassus saw him there. These three men agreed among them-
selves that Pompeius and Crassus should be elected consuls for the next
year ; that Caesar's government should be extended five years, and that
he should have some money for the Gallie war. Cicero knew this, and
he saw that he must submit to the will of Caesar and his allies, or have
them for enemies. He tells it all himself: no enemy invented it (Ad
Fam. i. 9). Caesar had complained to Pompeius at Luca about Cicero’s
motion on the Campanian land. Pompeius expostulated with Cicero’s
brother Quintus, and told him “that if he did not manage his brother
Marcus, 119 must be content to pay what he had become surety for on his
behalf.'’ This was a threat plain enough to understand. Cicero not only
kept quiet, but he voted for or moved for an allowance to Caesar from the
treasury to prosecute the war against the Veneti3 and somewhat later,
in May or June (13.0. 56), 119 delivered his speech De Provinciis Consu-
laribus, a fiowery piece of rhetoric, too fine to be taken as sincere, even
if we knew no more about the occasion of its delivery than the speech
tells us. But when we know the true motives of the speaker and his real
