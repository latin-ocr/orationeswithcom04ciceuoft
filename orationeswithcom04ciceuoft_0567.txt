GAP. 8—10. ’ 545

simo civi, mortem denuntiare, si in senatum venisset ; D. Carfule-
num, bene de re publica sentientem, e senatu vi et minis mortis expel-
lere; Ti Ganutium, a quo erat honestissimis contentionibus et saepe
et jure vexatus, non templo solum, verum etiam aditu prohibere
Capitolii. Oui senatusconsulto ne intercederent verebatur? De
supplicatione, credo, M. Lepidi clarissimi viri. Atque id erat peri-
culum, de cujus honore extraordinario quotidie aliquid cogitabamus,
ne ejus usitatus honos impediretur. Ac ne sine caussa videretur
edixisse ut senatus adesset, quum de re publiea relaturus fuisset,
allato nuntio de legione Quarta mente concidit, et fugere festinans
senatusconsultum de supplicatione per discessionem fecit, quum id

sactum esset antea numquam.

X] Quae vero profectio postea, quod iter paludati, quae vitatio

ne intercederent] Lest the Tribuni
should put their ‘ veto.’ He says ‘ de sup-
plicatione, ered0,’ ironically. Caesar had
given Lepidus the provinces of Gallia Nar-
bonensis and Hispania Citerior. He was
still with some troops before the city at the
time of Caesar’s death. Plutarch (Cae-
sar, c. 67) seems to mean to say that Lepi-
dus was in the senate-house when Caesar
was killed; but Dion (44, c. 2) and Appian
(ii. c. 118) say that he was not. Appian
says that Lepidus was in the Forum when
he heard of Caesar’s death. He went to his
provinces with a commission to come to
terms with Sex. Pompeius in Spain. The
bargain was made with Pompeius, who was
to be indemnified by the state for the loss
of his father's property. In the session of
the 28th of November, Antonius got the
⁴ supplicatio ' granted in honour of Lepidus'
bargain with Pompeius.

de leqione Quarta] See c. 3, and the
note.—‘ per discessionem :’ , “ senatusque
consultum ficri duobus modis, aut per ‹lis-
cessionem, si eonsentiretur; aut si res dubia
esset, per singulorum sententias exquisita-³¹¹
(Varro, quoted by Gellius xiv. c. 7). Gel-
lius appears to suppose that this did not
agree with what Ateius Capito “in conjec-
taneis scriptum reliquit. Nam in libro du-
centesimo quinquagesimo nono Tuberonem
dicere ait, nullum senatusconsultum fieri
posse non discessione facta, quia in omni-
bus senatusconsultis, etiam in iis quae per
relationem fierent, discessio esset necessaria,
idque ipse Capito verum esse affirmat.''
But Gellius says that he writes about all
this more particularly in another place.
However, whether Gellius misunderstood it
or not, it is certain that a ‘ senatusconsul-
tum per discessionem factum ⁹ is a Setum
made ‘ per discessionem ’ simply, when the

VOL. lv.

senate were unanimous, or when it was
made without any discussion or talk. When
a Setum was made after discussion, it was
said to be made ‘ per relationem'3’ but still
a ‘discessio’ was necessary. In this in-
stance, as Becker says (Handbuch, &e. ii.
2, p. 435), the strangeness of the proceed-
ing consisted in Antonius not asking the
senators their opinion, for on such occasions
it was usual for the consul to eall on the
senators to speak (sententiae rogabantur),
and thus to give the friends of the man who
was to be honoured the opportunity of say-
ing something about him. Becker observes
that when Antonius had moved iu the
senate to ‘ abolish the Dictatomhip, it was
done at once,' “ de qua ne sententias qui-
dem diximus ” (Phil. i. c. l): it was done
simply ‘per discessionem.' To this prac-
tice Ateius Capito opposes ⁴ senatusconsul-
tum per relationem faecre,’ after debate.
Becker also quotes the Lex Dc Imp. Vespas.

10. paludati] He went out ‘ paludatus,’
wearing the ‘paludamentum.’ See Index,
Vol. i. Appian (B. C. iii. c. 46) says that.
when Antonius retired to Tibur, nearly all
the senate and most. of the Equites, and
the most respectable part of the Plebs went
there to pay their respects to him. He went
on to Ariminum with his troops in splendid
style.—‘vespertina:' he is speaking ironi-
cally. It was not usual to make Sota in the
evening. The rule was that a Sctum mado
before sum-ise, or after sunset was not
valid (Varro, quoted by Gellius xiv. 7).
But this rulo was not always observed, as
