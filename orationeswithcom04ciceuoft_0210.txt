petentem aut etiam recusantem bellum suscipere, exercitum ducere
coegisset, tamen erat angusti animi atque demissi justi triumphi
honorem dignitatemque contemnere. Nam ut levitatis est inanem
aucupari rumorem et omnes umbras etiam falsae gloriae consectari,
sic est animi lucem splendoremque fugientis justam gloriam, qui est
fructus verae virtutis honestissimus, repudiare. Quum vero non
modo non postulante atque cogente, sed invito atque oppresso
senatu, non modo nullo populi Romani studio, sed nullo ferente
suffragium libero, provincia tibi ista manupretium fuerit non eversae «
per te sed perditae civitatis, quumque omnium tuorum scelerum
haec pactio exstiterit, ut, si tu totam rem publicam nefariis latro-
nibus tradidisses, Macedonia tibi ob eam rem quibus tu finibus
velles redderetur, quum exhauriebas aerarium3 quum orbabas
Italiam juventute3 quum mare vastissimum hieme transibas; si
triumphum contemnebas, quae te, praedo amentissime, nisi praedae
ac rapinarum cupiditas tam caeca rapiebat? Non est integrum
Cn. Pompeio consilio jam uti tuo. Erravit enim. Non gustarat
istam tuam philosophiam. Ter jam homo stultus triumphavit.

has ⁴ sic est levis animis ς’ but the oppositionis
between ‘levitatis’ and ‘ animi lucem fugi-
entis.’ (Wunder, Var. Lect. p. liv, who
approves of omitting ‘levis‚' has some re-
marks on this passage.) Madvig also de-
clares ‘levis' to be an interpolation. There
is no harm done by leaving it. Whether it
should be left out, is not quite so certain as
the critics suppose. But argumentation on
the readings, founded on a consideration of
logical and oratorical propriety, leads to
tedious notes, for such arguments cannot
generally be put in few words—¹ manu-

Faernus. The word ⁴ manupretium ' is
explained (Verr. ii. l, c. 56).-- ⁴ redderetur τ’
‘traderetur' Faernus, Halm. The common
reading is ⁸ redderetur‚' but V. has ¹ utrade-
retur‚' which is ‘ traderetur) But perhaps
‘ redderetur ' is right, for it represents what
. Piso got for selling the state. ,

done: he had enjoyed three triumphs.—
‘ formidolosissimo bello:' the war with
Spartacus’ gladiators, which M. Crassus
finished. He had an ovation for his victory,
and a crown of bay (Plutarch, Crassus, c.
113 Gellius, V. 6); though a crown of
myrtle was worn in ovations. But Crassus
refused the myrtle crown, and the senate
granted him a crown of bay. (See Pliny,
xv. c. 19.) P. Servilius Isauricus, who
defeated the pirates, Metellus, who con-
quered Crete, and others who are present
are addressed.

no triumph of Afranius is mentioned.—
‘ Pomptinus ε’ he was a praetor in B.c. 63,
and afterwards governor of Gallia Provincia.
At this time he was waiting for his triumph
over the Allobroges, which he had in the
next year (3.0. 54). So long did his ene-
mies keep from him the honour of which he
was ambitious. Perhaps the ‘religionibus
