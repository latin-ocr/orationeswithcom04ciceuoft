296 ORAT. PRO G. RABIRIO POSTUMO

factaeque syngraphae sunt in Albano Cn. Pompeii, quum ille Roma
profectus esset, tamen non debuit is qui dabat, quo modo ille qui
accipiebat consumeret, quaerere. Non enim latroni, sed regi crc-
didit ; nec regi inimico populi Romani, sed ei cujus reditum consuli
mandatum a senatu videbat3 nec ei regi qui alienus ab hoc imperio
esset, sed ei quicum foedus feriri in Capit-olio viderat. Quod si
creditor in culpa sit, non qui improbe credita pecunia usus est„
damnetur is qui fabricatus gladium est et vendidit, non is qui illo.
gladio civem aliquem interemit. Quamobrem neque tu, C. Memmi,
hoc facere debes, ut senatum, cujus auctoritati te ab adolescentia
dedisti, in tanta infamia versari velis, neque ego id quod non agitur
defendere. Postumi enim caussa quaecumque est sejuncta a senatu
est. Quod si item a Gabinio sejunctam ostendero, certe quod dicas
nihil habebis.

synqraphae] See Vol. i.‚ Index. The

applies only to remote times, for the Foedus
money was lent for Ptolemaeus' use, as

made with the ‘legatus ' of Antiochus was

he says, and lent at the Alban villa of Pom-
peius. ‘Ille Roma’is Pompeius. Hotmann
proposes to write ‘ illo,’ because Rabirius'
case would be better if the money had been
lent in Pompeius' presence than in his ab·
sence. He also says that if we read ‘ille'
we cannot understand whither Pompeius had
gone. As the text stands, Cicero says that
Pompeius had left Rome; and we must be
content to be ignorant of some of the great
man’s movements.

reditum . . mandatum] This is Halm’s
reading. Muretus found in one of his two
MSS. ⁴ cujus reditum consulicum datum,'
and he conjectured that we should read
‘ cujus reditum consuli commendatum.'
The consul, I suppose, is Ρ. Lentulus Spin-
ther. This Foedus was made, says Manu-
tius, when Caesar was consul, as he writes
in the third book of his Civil VVar. Hot-
mann refers to a passage of Festus : ‘⁴ Fere-
trius Juppiter, dictus a ferendo, quod pacem
ferre putaretur: ex cujus templo sumebant
sceptrum per quod jurarent et lapidem sili-
cem quo foedus ferirent.'' This temple
was on the Capitol, and trcaties were made
there, and the treaties were kept in the
temple. Osenbrueggen (De Jure Pacis et
Belli, p. 93, &c.) has some remarks on the
formalities observed in making Foedera.
He says that if the Foedus was made in the
city, it seems certain that the Comitium
was the usual place, but that this remark

made in the Capitol (Livy 37, c. 55).

Quod si creditor, issa] The reading of
the ed. Basil, 1528 (Halm). He follows
Madvig, who bas ‘ Quod si creditoris culpa
cst, si qui.' Mommsen proposes ⁴ Quod s
creditores in culpa sunt, si qui‚’ which is
better, and nearer to the MSS. reading
‘creditor is in culpa.' The comparison
does not help Cicero's case. If a man sells
a sword to another, when he knows that
the buyer is going to use it for an illegal
purpose, he does wrong.

4. Quo] The words ‘ quo . . . pervene-
rit’ are a quotation from the Lex Julia De
Repetundis. We may translate it: ‘For
this case founded on the words os the Lex
Quo, Sec. is a kind of appendage to a case
which has been tried and in which judg-
ment has been given)

lites aestimatae] The damages were as-
sessed against Gabinius, but neither secu-
rities (praedes) were given, nor was the
amount recovered by the sale of his pro-
perty. Halm, following Mommsen, has
“nec ex bonis populo universa pecunia
exacta est.'’ The reading in the text is
from the MS. of Ciofanus (Muretus, Var.
Lect. xvii. c. 5); but Muretus has omitted
¹ populo‚’ as Halm correctly observes. In
some editions there is ‘a populo recepta
est. Lex aequa est‚’ which, as Hotmann
says, has no meaning in it, and using his
‘codex pervetustus’ he writes ‘a populo
