INTRODUCTION TO THE SECOND PHILIPPIC.

CICERo's first Philippie was delivered on the 2nd of September (Introd.
to the Phils.); and it broke off all hopes of a reconciliation between
him and Antonius, who retired to his villa at Tibur to prepare an answer.
On the leth of September he appeared in the senate and replied to
Cicero, who was not present, as he tells us (Phil. iii. c. 133 v. c. '7; Ad
Div. xii. 2). This second Philippic however is written as if it were an
answer to Antonius, and delivered on the 19th of September. But it
was only a written speech, and it was not published. Some critics have
supposed that Cicero alludes to this oration Ad Att. xv. 13: “ orationem
tibi misi. Ejus custodiendae et proferendae arbitrium tuum. Sed
quando illum diem, quum tu edendum putes ?’' But this letter was
written before the first Philippic was delivered, and the oration to which
he alludes is one which Atticus wished him to write on the same subject
as Brutus’ Capitoline speech <Ad Att. xv. 3 and 4). The following
words allude to this oration (Ad Att. xvi. 11): “ Atque utinam illum
diem videam quum ista oratio ita libere vagetur ut etiam in Siccae
domum introeat,'’ and there are other allusions in it.

Cicero in the first part of this oration answers the charges of Anto-
nius, and then (c. 18) he begins his attach, which is a review of all the
life of Antonius, a pieee of abuse which it would be hard to match, and
Antonius could not forgive it, whether it was true or false. I do not
know if there is any evidence that Antonius ever saw this speech, but he
may have had a copy sent him by some kind friend. It is generally
assumed that this oration was the cause of Cicero being included in the
proscription of the next year (13.6. 43) ; but there was ground enough in
his other Philippics and his conduct in the senate for Antonius getting
rid of him. Octavianus Caesar too, who had fiattered and deceived
Cicero for a time, had the Dietator’s death to revenge3 and it is no
· wonder if he would not sparo a man who was his great uncle’s bitterest
enemy, and an obstacle to his own amhitious designs.

There is no great difficulty in this oration. lt contains many allu-

· sions to thc events which preceded and followed Caesar's death, but the.

general Introduction and the notes are sufficient to make it easily under-
stood.
