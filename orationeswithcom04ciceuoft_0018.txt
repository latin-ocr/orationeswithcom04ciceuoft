xii PREFAOE.

either be very vain or very foolish, and certainly they have a very
insufficient notion of the difficulties of such a work. Where the
matter is so large and various, opinions so much divided on obscure
passages, and references so numerous, many errors must be com-
mitted. I have received several useful suggestions and remarks
from various gentlemen, who are strangers to me3 and I have
always found that those whose communications were the best, were
also most indulgent to those slips and errors which even the most
accurate and careful will make. It is a fact, which any man may
convince himself of by making the experiment of writing notes, that
an editor will sometimes blunder in an easy passage and commit
errors which a schoolboy may correct ; and for this reason among
others, that his vigilance is more active and his understanding too,
when he sees a real difficulty and tries to grapple with it. There
is another thing too that he may discover. His attention being
necessarily engaged with a number of small matters, he may some-
times overlook the general purport of the discourse and of the com-
position, which another man who reads carefully cannot fail to see.
Accordingly, Ι find that on using for the instruction of youth what
I have written, I am sometimes dissatisfied, and could easily mend
my work ; which Ι shall do, if ever Ι have the opportunity.

Mr. Macleane, who in conjunction with me had the general
management of this series, used to read over my proof sheets, as I
read over the proof sheets of his Horace, Juvenal, and Persius.
Unfortunately for me his health was often bad, and I had not al-
ways the advantage of his suggestions. In the last volume par-
ticularly, he was only able to read part of the sheetS, which I
much regret. His remarks were always good and practical. His
prematur-e death is a loss to letters. Many men had more learning,
as it is called, a great deal of which however is a thing that Ι do
not value at all; but Ι have never known any man who had a more
genuine love for the best writers of ant-iquity, or a juster judgment
in duly appreciating them. ,
