OAP. 8—10. 415

iratus, non domum, ne iners, non in aliquam regionem, ne condem-
nare caussam illam quam secutus erat videretur3 in Macedoniam
ad Cn. Pompeii castra venit, in eam ipsam caussam, a qua erat re-
jectus [cum] injuria. Quid, quum ista res nihil commovisset ejus
animum ad quem veneratis, languidiore, credo, studio in caussa
fuistis ; tantummodo in praesidiis eratis, animi vero a caussa abhor-
rebant: an, ut fit in civilibus bellis—nec in vobis magis quam in
reliquis3 omnes enim vincendi studio tenebamur: pacis equidem
semper auctor fui, sed tum sero ς erat enim amentis quum aciem vi-
deres pacem cogitare—omnes, inquam, vincere volebamus, tu certe
praecipue, qui in eum locum veneras ubi tibi esset pereundum nisi
vicisses. Quamquam, ut nunc se res habet, non dubito quin hanc
salutem anteponas illi victoriae. X. Haec ego non dicerem, Tubero,
si aut vos constantiae vestrae aut Gaesarem beneficii sui poeniteret.
Nunc quaero utrum vestras injurias an rei publicae persequamini.
Si rei publicae, quid de vestra in ea caussa perseverantia responde-
bitis? Si vestraS, videte ne erretis, qui Gaesarem vestris inimicis
iratum fore putetis, quum ignoverit suis. Itaque num tibi videor
in caussa Ligarii esse occupatus, num de ejus facto dicere Ξ Quid-
quid dixi, ad unam summam referri volo vel humanitatis vel cle-
mentiae vel misericordiae. Oaussas, Caesar, egi multas, et quidem
tecum, dum te in foro tenuit ratio honorum tuorum, certe num—

[cum] injuria] G. Εἴ. C. omit ‘cum.'

nihil commovisset] ⁴ Ista res ¹ refers to
‘ rejectus.’ Pompeius was not moved at all
by the insult which his partizan Tubero
had received in Africa.

in praesidiis] ‘in the camp,’ ‘in the
army,' ‘ within the lines.'—‘ civilibus bellis :’
Madvig supposes that something has been
lost after these words3 but the words be-
tween ¹ civilibus bellis’ and ‘ omnes inquam'
seem as other critics have suggested to be
parenthetical matter, and the first part of
the sentence is thus connected well enough
with the latter part in sense, though not in
strict granimatical propriety.—‘ in eum lo-
cum 2’ the camp of Pompeius, as Manutius
explains it. Halm suggests that ⁴ locus ¹
may have the figurative sense, ‘you had
got into such a position! ,

10. tibi videor] ⁸ tibi videor, Caesar,’
Orelli, and other earlier editions, which also
have ⁸ misericordiae tuae.’—‘ad unam sum-
mani :’ the sanie as ⁴ ad unum caput) All
that he has said applies not to the defence
of Ligarium but is directed to one single
thing, call it humanity, cleineucy‚ or mercy,
which you please.

caussas . . . si umquam posthac] Quoted
by Quintilian vii. 4. 17. Caesar often ap-
peared as an orator while he was pursuing
the usual road to the ‘honores‚’ which
Cicero calls the ‘ratio honorum tuorum!
At the age of twenty-one, or, as some
would have it, twenty-three, he prosecutcd
Dolabella (B.c. 77), and the orations which
he delivered on that occasion wei-c still read
with admiration when the author of the
“De Oratoribus Dialogus’' wrote (c. 34).
Cicero also speaks of Caesar's oratorical
talents iu his Brutus (c. 72). He says that
Caesar spoke Latin better than almost any
orator; and he added to this propricty ol'
speech, the oratorical ornaments, which
Cicero likens to the placing of good pic-
tures in a good light. Quintilian says (x.
l. 114) that if C. Caesar had given all liis
time to the Forum, no other Roman could
have been named as a match for Ciccr0;
‘⁴ so much enei-gy is there in him, such
acuteness, such life, that it appears that lic
spoke with the same spirit with which lic
fought. And yet all this is sct oll' by a
propriety of languagc (¹ sermonis clc-
gantia') os which he was particularly stu-
