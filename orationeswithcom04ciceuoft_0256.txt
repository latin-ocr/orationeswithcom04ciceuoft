ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO '

sint professi videro, dicam: Hic familia consulari est, ille praetoria:
reliquos video esse ex equestri loco: sunt omnes sine macula, sunt
omnes aeque boni viri atque integri, sed servari necesse est gradus :
cedat consulari generi praetorium, ne contendat cum praetorio no-
mine equester locus. Sublata sunt studia, exstinctae suffragationes,
nullae contentiones, nulla libertas populi in mandandis magistra-
tibus, nulla exspectatio suffragiorum: nihil, ut plerumque evenit,
praeter opinionem accidet3 nulla erit posthac varietas comitiorum. ἱ
Sin hoc persaepe accidit ut et factos aliquos et non factos esse
miremur3 si campus'atque illae undae comitiorum ut mare pro-
fundum et immensum sic effervescunt quodam quasi aestu ut ad,
alios accedant, ab aliis autem recedant, tanto nos impetu studiorum

two of the old MSS. have ‘ diribentur ς’ 1116
rest have ¹ dirimerentur,‘ ⁸ diriumntur,’ and
‘ dirimentur.’ Schneider has selected ⁶ diri-
meritur ' in his edition. In the passage of
Varro (iii. 5> Schneider has printed ‘diri-
merent,⁷ though he gives no authority for
it, and yet 116 quotes one MS. for ‘diri-
berent,' and others which have ‘ diriperent!
Schneider has made a bad affair of 111656
two passages, both in his text and in his
notes. In the passage ofValerius Maximus,
none of the MsS. have ‘diriberentur 3' but
they have either ⁴ darentur' or ‘ dieerentun'
There is however a various reading ‘ diriva-
rentur’ and ‘dii-uirentur,’ which are sup-
posed to iudicate the reading ‘ diriberentur,'
and Pighius proposed this correction. But
Vorstius remarks on this correction of
Pighius, that though the Romans said
⁴ diribere tabellas,' that does not prove that
they could say ‘ diribere sententias! Wun-
der has an answer to this objection, but
whether it is a sufficient answer or not, Ι
do not know.

It is however certain that there 15 3 verb
‘diribere,’ and that it 1135 116611 sometimes
corrupted. Wunder's conclusion is that it
means to separate the votes, and determine
what votes are given to each candidate, and
in the voting for a Lex what votes are given
sor and what votes against it.

agitationes fluctuum, quantas perturbationes
et quantos aestus habet ratio comitiorum'⁷
(Wunder). Victorius, he says, has aptly
compared the pass age in the περὶ παρα-
⁷27 εσβείας of Demosthenes, p. 383, ed.

μ {anto nos impetu] Wunder 0111115”111,’
which is generally placed before ζ131110,’
and he omits it on the authority of the best
MSS„ though he admits that the preposi-
tion could be used here3 and there is no
doubt of that. Caesar has an instance some-
thing like it (B. G. iii. 8), “in magno im-
petu maris.'' T. E.have ‘tamen nos impetu,'
and Baiter edits ‘ tamen nos in impetu.'
Wunder has a long note on the use of
the Latin ablative, a use which all careful
readers must have observed. He says,
“ Nam saepe etiam nullo adjecto participio
solom substantivom cum adjectivo vel geni-
tivo alius substantivi casu ablativo ecfertur
eodem sensu, quo qui volgo dicuntur abla-
tivi consequentiaeponuntur. Maxumeque
ad eum usum adhibita sunt substantiva
verbalia, qualia sunt adventus, concursus,
comitatus, conventus, decessus, discessus,
inpetus, motus, profectio et a-lia.” His
meaning is made clearer by examples, of
which he quotes a page full, but I do not
think that all his exa-mples 316 to the pur-
pose, though what he intends to say is
true. There is one from the In Pisonem,
c. 23, which will be the nearest to hand:
“scio item virum fortem . . . adventu isto
tuo domi fuisse otiosum.'’ Caesar contains
many better examples of this usage. The
following 15 striking, but it is a perfectly
pure Latin idiom: “sed nulla ferramen-
torum copia quae esset ad hunc usum
idonea, gladiis cespites circumcidere co-
gebantur'' (B. G. v. 42); ‘but as they
had no supply of iron implements fit for
this purpose, they were compelled to cut
out the turf with their swords.' Thei‘qe 15
another example in the Β. G. ii. 9,
cundiore equitum proelio,'' &c., and B. SG.
