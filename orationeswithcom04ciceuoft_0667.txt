tatis, minime hujus ordinis. Bello Antiochino magno et gravi,
quum L. Scipioni provincia Asia obvenisset, parumque in eo puta-
retur esse animi, parum roboris, senatusque ad collegam ejus O.
Laelium, hujus Sapientis patrem, negotium deferret, surrexit P.
Africanus, frater major L. Scipionis, et illam ignominiam a familia
deprecatus est, dixitque et in fratre suo summam virtutem esse
summumque consilium, neque se ei legatum id aetatis iisque rebus
gestis defuturum. Quod quum ab eo esset dictum, nihil est de
Scipionis provincia commutatum, nec plus extraordinarium impe-
rium ad id bellum quaesitum quam duobus antea maximis Punicis
bellis, quae a consulibus aut a dictatoribus gesta et confecta sunt,
aut quam Pyrrhi, quani Philippi, quam post Achaico bello, quam
Punico tertio 3 ad quod populus Romanus ita sibi ipse delegit ido-
neum ducem P. Scipionem, ut eum tamen bellum gerere consulem
vellet. VIII. Cum Aristonico bellum gerendum fuit P. Licinio
L. Valerio consulibus. Rogatus est populus, quem id bellum
gerere placeret: Crassus, consul et pontifex maximus, Flacco col-
legae, flamini Martiali, mulctam dixit si a sacris discessisset, quam
mulctam populus remisit; pontifici tamen flaminem parere jussit.
Sed ne turn quidem populus Romanus ad privatum detulit bellum,

Cn. Pompeius hythe Lex Manilia, in favour
write ¹ illius ' for ‘ hujus ;' but ⁴ hic ’ does

of which Cicero delivered an oration (De

Imp. Cn. Pompeii, Vol. ii.). This was one
proposal. The other is explained in c. 9.
Cicero calls it ‘ventosum‚' a word which
Horace has used z

‘⁶ Non ego ventosae plebis suffragia venor.''
(Ep. i. 19, v. 37.)

Antiochino] ⁴ Antiochi ' a b g. C. Lae-
lius was the father of the Laelius called
Sapiens, one of the speakers in the Dialogue
De Amicitia. The elder Laelius was the
friend of Africanus Maj0r; the younger
was the friend of Africanus Minor.—‘ neque
se ei legatumz’ he offered to serve under
his younger brother, though he had done
such great things. It was not unusual at
Rome for a man who had been consul to
serve under others. ‘¹ P. Scipio Africanus
dixit, Si L. Scipioni fratri suo provinciam
decrevissent, se legatum iturum'' (Livy,
37, c. l; ΒΛ). l!l()).—-¹ hujus Sapientisz’
Pighius proposed ‘ C. Laelium Laelii Sapi-
entis! because it was not probable that
Laelius was then alive, much less that he
was in the senate when Cicero said this.
Of course he was not. A man who was
born about B.c. 186 was not alive in ΒΛ).

either present or alive.

Philippi] King of Macedonia, who was
conquered by T. Quinctius Flamininus. The
Achaic war was that which ended with the
capture of Corinth by L. Mummius, ΒΛ).

‘for which war the Roman people selected
a competent commander, P. Scipio, and yet
it was their pleasure that he should conduct
the war in the capacity of consul.’ Afri-
canus Minor was elected consul in ac. 1⁴7,
before he had attained the legal age, and he
received Africa for his province with a eom-
mission to take Carthago, which he did ac.

8. Aristonico] In ae. 131. Ρ. Licinius
Crassus and L. Valerius Flaccus were con-
suls. There was war with Aristonicus, who
claimed the kingdom of Pergamum, which
the king. the last Attalus, had bequeathed
to the Romans (Liv. Ep. 593 Strabo. p.
646 ›.—‘ mulctam dixit ι’ he imposed on him
a fine if he should leave his duties as
Flamen.
