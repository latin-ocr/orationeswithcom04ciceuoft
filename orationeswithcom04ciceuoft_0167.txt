CAP. 21, 22. 145

Italico bello maximis gestis P. Caesium equitem Romanum, virum
bonum, qui vivit Ravennae, foederato ex populo, nonne civitate
donavit? quid, cohortes duas universas Camertium? quid, Hera-
cliensem Alexam P. Crassus, vir amplissimus, ex ea civitate, quacum
prope singulare foedus Pyrrhi temporibus C. Fabricio consule ictum
putatur? quid, Massiliensem Aristonem [L] Sulla? quid, quoniam
de Gaditanis agimus, idem heros novem Gaditanos? quid, vir sanc-
tissimus et summa religione ac modestia, Q. Metellus Pius, Q.
Fabium Saguntinum? quid, hic qui adest, a quo haec, quae ego
nunc percurro, subtilissime sunt onmia perpolita, M. Crassus, nou
Avennensem foederatum civitate donavit, homo quum gravitate et-
prudentia praestans, tum vel nimium parcus in largienda civitate?
Hic tu Cn. Pompeii beneficium vel potius judicium et factum in-
firmare conaris, qui fecit quod C. Marium fecisse audierat, fecit- quod
P. Crassum, quod L. Sullam, quod Q. Metellum, quod denique
domesticum auctorem patrem suum facere viderat? Neque vero id
in uno Cornelio fecit. Nam et Gaditanum Hasdrubalem ex bello
illo Africano, et Mamertinos obvios, et quosdam Uticenses et
Saguntinos Fabios civitate donavit. Etenim quum ceteris praemiis
digni sunt, qui suo labore et periculo nostram rem publicam defen-
dunt, tum certe dignissimi sunt qui civitate ea donentur, pro qua

Gaditanum.’ Probably we have lost tho

man’s name, and only one person was men·

was consul during the Italic war (ac. 89).
He defeated the Picentes and the Marsi,

and did other service in this wan—⁴ qui
vivit- Ravennae :’ Baiter ¹ qui vivit, Raven-
natem.' I do not know what is the autho-
rity for either of these readings; nor do Ι
find any notice of Ravenna having a Foedus
with Rome.

Camertium] After ⁴ Camertium’ Baiter
adds ¹ C.Marins.' Plutarch (Marius, c. 28);
“Marius had presented with the citizen-
ship a thousand of the people of Cameri-
num, who had particularly distinguished
themselves in the war; this was considered
to be an illegal proceeding, and being
charged with it by several persons iu
public, he replied that he could not hear
the law for the din of arms.”

Heracliensem Aleoeam] Lambinus’ rc-
storation of the corrupt MSS. readings,
and a very probable restoration. It is a
correction which can do no harm, even isit
is not true, for the only mistake will bc in
the man's name. Some editors have ‘ He-
racleensem legionem) which is rather too
much. As to Heraclea. see vol. iii. lndex.

P. Crassus] The father of M. Crassus,
now living—⁸ idem herosz' something is
corrupt here. Baiter print: ‘ msnovem

VOL. lv,

tioned, though C. has ¹ Gaditanos!

Q. BIelellus Pius] He who commanded
against Sertorius in Spain. Cicero speaks
of Metellus’ ⁶ modestia ς’ but Sallust (Hisr.
ii.), quoted by Abrami, and Plutarch. Sei·-
torius (c. 22), give a different account οἵ
him. Metellus was greatly elated by a vic-
tory over Sertorius, and showed that hc had
a great deal of vanity and little sense.—
‘ Avennensem ε’ some corrupted name pro-
bably. The common reading in the printed
books is ‘ Aletrinensem! The only name
which resembles the MSS. would be ⁸ Ave-
nionensem.' an ethnic name of Aveniu
(Avignon) in Gallia Narbonensis—⁴ quod
P. Crassum ι’ Baiter conjectures that iu
this enumeration the words ‘ quod M. Cras-
sum' have been lost; and he makes this
conclusion by comparing c. 28.

illo Africano] In the war which Pom-
peius conducted in Africa against (¹11. llu-
mitius and Hiarbas king of the Numidae.
B.c. 81. (Dc Imp. Cn. Pompeii. c. 10, und
the note.)

obvios] A corrupted word. for which
Baiter has substituted Buchanan's emcnda-
tion ‘ Ovios 5⁹ but it is of no value.
