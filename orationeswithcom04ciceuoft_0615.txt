INTRODUOTION TO THE SEVENTH PHILIPPIC.

THIS oration was delivered in the senate before the festival of the Luper-
calia, which took place in February (xv Kal. Mart), and before the re-
turn of the commissioners wh'o had been sent to M. Antonius. Dion
(46, c. 29) mentions the embassy sent to Antonius (Introd. to Phil. vi.).
Dion adds ε “ And no long time after, before they knew Antonius' deci-
sion, they voted that it was a Tumultus, and they put off the senatorial
dress (comp. Phil. v. c. 12). They gave instructions to the consuls and
to Caesar, who had received praetorian rank, to carry on war against An-
tonius, and they ordered Lepidus and L. Munatius Plancus, the go-
vernor of part of Gallia beyond the Alps, to support the consuls and

ansar.’'
