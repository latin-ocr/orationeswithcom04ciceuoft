TO THE PHILIPPIOAE. 457

no expense, in the hope that the popular feeling might be changed by the
splendour of the shows, that the Liberators might be invited back to
Rome. The peo ple were much pleased with what Brutus had prepared for
their amusement3 and they applauded, but that was all (Ad Att. xvi. 2).
There is a joint letter from Brutus and Cassius to Antonius dated the
ath of August, in which they complain of an insulting letter of Antonius
in answer to some demand that they had made to him. They were evi-
dently preparing to leave Italy (Ad Div. xi. 3). Cicero, who had been
for some time absent from Rome, had already set out for Greeee. On
the 28th of J uly he was at Rhegium, whence he passed over to Syra-
cuse. On his voyage from Syracuse he was driven back to Leucopetra,
a place at the extremity of Italy, and in the neighbourhood of Rhegium.
There he heard that there was a better prospect at Rome, that the recall
of the Liberators was expected, that his absence was complained of, and
that he was wanted (Ad Att. xvi. 7). He immediately resolved to re-
turn to Rome. He reached Velia on the coast of Lucania on the I7th
of August, at the time when Brutus with his vessels was at the mouth
of the river Hales, which is about three miles from Velia. This was the
last time that they met. Brutus, who was on his way to the east, was
rejoieed that Cicero was returning to Rome. He expressed his sorrow
that Cicero had not been there earlier, and at the sitting of the senate
af the lst of August, when L. Piso, the Dictator’s father-in-law, had
apposed Antonius and taken the place that belonged to Cicero. On the
leth of August Cicero landed at his Pompeianum, not well resolved
what to do. At last he returned to Rome on the 31st of August.

Antonius had fixed a meeting of the senate in the temple of Con-
:ordia on the lst of September, when he intended to propose that cer-
2ain honours should be paid to Caesar's memory. Cicero pretended
2hat he was too tired with his journey to be present, and Antonius
:hreatened him for not appearing (Phil. i. e. 5). The following day the
{enate sat again in the temple of Concordia. Antonius was not present,
Jut Cicero was, and he delivered his first Philippie‚ in which he ex-
>2lained his reasons for leaving Italy and returning, and complained of
2he conduct of Antonius and his eolleague Dolabella, yet 111 such terms
ts showed that he still hoped that a quiet settleinent of affairs might bo
nade. This speech made Antonius break off all further connexion, and
;hey became declared enemies.

There are fourtecn orations entitled Philippicae. The origin of this
1ame is not known. According to the collection of letters entitled Ad
3rutum, Cicero first named them so in jest, and Brutus adopted tho
lame (Ad Brut. ii. 4 and 5). A. Gellius always calls them Orationes
&ntonianae3 but in the MSS. and elsewhere they are always named
