PRO C. RABIRIO POSTUMO

ORATIO.

IN TRODUOTION.

ProLnMAEus, named Auletes, king of Egypt, being driven out by the
Egyptians, or having fied for sear of them, went to Rome in Bc. 5S to
entreat the senate to restore him. On his voyage to Rome he called at
Rhodes, where he had an interview with Μ. Cato, which Plutarch (Cat.
Min. c. 35) has described in a very amusing way. then Ptolemaeus got
to Rome he wanted money, which he borrowed and employed in bribing
some of the senators. His connexion with Rabirius seems to have
begun before he was at Rome (c. 2). Rabirius found money for the
king. In B.c. 56 Cicero, who was under obligations to P. Lentulus
Spinther, on account of his restoration from exile, made a speech in the
senate (Pro Rege Alexandrino), in which he supported Lentulus' claim
to manage the business of Ptolemaeus. Lentulus was now Proeonsul
of Cilicia and Cyprus (13.0. 56), and in a convenient position to attend
to the affairs of Egypt. It had been determined the year before that
the future Proeonsul of Cilicia should restore Ptolemaeus, and Lentulus
was now the Proconsu13 but at the close of Be. 57 the encmies of Leu-
tulus found something in the Sibylline books, or they invented it, which
declared that it would be dangerous to the Roman state if an Egyptian
king should be restored by force of arms. This led to many discussions
in the senate (13.0. 56) and to various proposals about the best way of
managing Ptolemaeus’ restoration.

As the business was likely to be profitable, the king’s restoration be-
came a party question. Both Lentulus and Pompeius wished to have the
commission. Cicero, in a letter to his brother (13.c. 56), says that tho
“ king's creditors were openly supplying money against Lentulus.'' This
hint would be more intelligible to his brother thau to us, but we may
' deduce somethingsrom it. Rabirius may have been active here also. All
