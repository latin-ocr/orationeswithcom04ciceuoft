144„ ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

qui de foederatis civitatibus esset civitate donatus, in judicium est·
vocatus? Nam Spoletinus T. Matrinius, unus ex iis quos C. Marius
civitate donasset, dixit caussam ex colonia Latina in primis firma et
illustri. Quem quum disertus homo L. Antistius accusaret, non
dixit fundum Spoletinum populum non esse factum—videbat enim
populos de suo jure, non de nostro, fundos fieri solere—sed, quum
lege Apuleia coloniae non essent deductae, qua lege Saturninus O.
Mario tulerat, ut in singulas colonias ternos cives Romanos facere
posset, negabat hoc beneficium re ipsa sublata valere debere. Nihil
habet similitudinis ista 3551153ῖίος sed tamen tanta auctoritas in C.
Mario fuit, ut non per L. Crassum, affinem suum, hominem incredibili
eloquentia, sed paucis ipse verbis caussam illam gravitate sua
defenderit et probarit. Quis enim esset, judices, qui imperatoribus
nostris in bello, in acie, in exercitu delectum virtutis, qui sociis, qui
foederatis in defendenda re publica nostra spem praemiorum eripi
vellet? Quod si vultus O. Marii, si vox, si ille imperatorius ardor
oculorum, si recentes triumphi, si praesens valuit aspectus, valeat
auctoritas, valeant res gestae, valeat memoria, valeat fortissimi et
clarissimi viri nomen aeternum. Sit hoc discrimen inter gratiosos
cives atque fortes, ut illi vivi fruantur opibus suis, horum etiam
mortuorum, si quisquam hujus imperii defensor mori potest, vivat
auctoritas immortalis. XXII. Quid, Cn, Pompeius pater rebus

civitates suas juberentur ” (Schol. Bob.
pro Sestio, p. 296).

Nam Spoletinus] ⁴ For as to the case
of T. Matrinius of Spoletium.’ Matrinius
belonged to a Latina colonia. Spoletium
(Spoleto) was in Umbria. The Colonia
was settled ss.c. 241.

The Lex Apuleia was one of the several
leges proposed by the tribune L. Apuleius
Saturninus. We know no more of this Lex
than what Cicero tells us, and what is con-
tained in a passage of Aurelius Victor (De
Viris Illustr. c. 73), who says that Saturni-
nus designed to send colonists to Sicily,
Achaia, and Macedonia. Victor also speaks
of a proposal by Saturninus to give to Ma-
rius’ veterans 005 hundred ‘ jugera ’ each in
Africa.

non dixit] ⁴ non Lallemandusy (Baiter).
The old text is ‘ Spoletinus dixit? E. omits
‘ Spoletinus) Manutius remarked that
⁴ Spoletinus' was not wanted, and that
‘ non’ was. The prosecutor did not say
that the man of Spoletium, a Latina co-
lonia, was not a Roman citizen, because
the people of Spoletium had not assented
to what Marius had conferred on him.
“He saw that it was the practice for

people ‘ fundi fieri ’ about something which
concerned their own state, and not about
something which concerned the Roman
State.'’—‘ re ipsa sublata :5 the ‘ coloniae ’
were not established, and accordingly the
power which Saturninus' Lex had given to
Marius (C. Mario tulerat) never existed,
for the power depended on the ‘ coloniae ’
being established.

In place of ¹ tulerat ’ Gronovius says
“Pater cogitavit fortassis legendum delu-
lerat.’' But the conjecture is unnecessary.

L. Crassum] The orator was connected
with Marius by marriage.

ardor oculorum] Marius had a ‘pecu-
liaris ardor oculorum ' says Abrami ; on
which he quotes the story of Marius in the
dungeon of Minturnae, when the slave who
was sent in to kill him saw his bright eyes
in the dark, and was alarmed at his terrible
voice. (Plutarch, Marius, c. 39.) This
chapter about Marius weakens Balbus' case.
Marius, as Cicero says, maintained what he
had done, though he had done it illegally;
and the example is recommended for imi-
tation.

22. Cn. Pompeius] The father of Ci-
cero’s great friend. Pompeius the father
