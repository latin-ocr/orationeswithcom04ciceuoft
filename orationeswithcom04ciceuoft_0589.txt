GAP. 4—6. 567

debere eodem tempore Romae et Athenis res judicare, accipietne
excusationem is qui quaestioni praeerit Graeculi judicis, modo pal-
liati, modo togati, an Atheniensium antiquissimas leges negliget?
Qui porro ille consessus, dii boni? Cretensis judex, isque nequis-
simus. Quemadmodum ad hunc reus alleget? quomodo accedat?
Dura, natio est. At Athenienses misericordes. Puto ne Curium
quidem esse crudelem, qui quotidie periculum fortunae facit. Sunt
item lecti judices, qui fortasse excusabuntur3 habent enim legiti-
mam excusationem, exsilii caussa solum vertisse nec esse postea
restitutos. Hos ille demens judices legisset, horum nomina ad ae-
rarium detulisset, his magnam partem rei publicae credidisset, si
ullam speciem rei publicae cogitavisset? VI. Atque ego de notis
judicibus dixi : quos minus nostis, nolui nominare, saltatores, citha-
ristas, totum denique comissationis Antonianae chorum in tertiam
decuriam judicum scitote esse conjectum. En caussam cur lex
tam egregia, tamque praeclara, maximo imbri, tempestate, ventis,
procellis, turbinibus, inter fulmina et tonitrua ferretur, ut eos ju-
dices haberemus, quos hospites habere nemo velit. Scelerum mag-
nitudo, conscientia maleficiorum, direptio ejus pecuniae, cujus ratio
in aede Opis confecta est, hanc tertiam decuriam excogitavit, nec
ante turpes judices quaesiti quam honestis judicibus nocentium
salus desperata est. Sed illud os, illam impuritatem caeni fuisse,

ground that he is an Areopagite, and can-
not act at the same time as a ,Iudex at
Rome and Athens, will the judge who pre-
sides accept his excuse? A man could not

say against it.—‘lecti judices . . . excusa-
buntur :’ there were various legal grounds
of excuse. The office of Judex was a
burdem and men were often glad to be re-

be a citizen of Rome and another state
(Pro Balbo, c. 11, and the note). He speaks
of him contemptuously as Graeculus, like
Juvenal, Sat. iii. v. 78:

“ Graeculus esuriens iu caelum jusseris
ibit.”

He is at one time Greek (palliatus),
at another time Roman (togatus).—‘an
Atheniensium :’ or will he not accept his
excuse. paying no regard to the Athenian
laws, by which, as we must conclude, an
Areopagite could not aet as a Judex in any
other place than Athens.

alleqet] I suppose this means, ‘How
shall he address such a man?' in his de-
fence. ‘Allegare' is not usually joined
with ‘ad' and an accusative. It has
generally an accusative after it. as ‘alle-
gare aliquid‚’ to allege something.

facit] ‘j'acit mei (sed V. sacti) ' Halm.
The common reading is ⁴ faciat 3' and if the
MSS. had it, we should have nothing to

lieved from serving‚ as men among us who
are summoned on juries. Some of Anto-
nius' Judices had an excellent reason for
being excuscd. They had quitted the
country (solum verterunt).

6. in tertiam decuriam] Phil. i. c. 8.

qnos hospites] ‘qnos socios ad epulas
hospites’ D. But it is better with V. to
drop ‘ socios ad epulas.’ Petrus Yictorius
proposed ‘quos socios ad epulas habere
hospes nemo velit;' on which Lambinus
has one of his long notes, half abusive of
Peter, half complimentary. Lambinus was
a scholar, but his learning had not made
him a man of good sense.

in aede Opis] Phil. ii. c. 38.—‘ nec . . .
honestis judicibus :’ ‘nor were Jndiees of
bad character looked for until there was
no hope of acquittal for the guilty with
honourable Judices.' &Vc may so translate
‘honestis judicibus.’ and in various other
ways. It is one of the uses of the Latin
ablativo.
