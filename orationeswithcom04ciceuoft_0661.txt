CAP. l, 2. 639
suae, consecutus est Dolabella. Nulla suspicione belli--quis enim
id putaret 3—secutae collocutiones familiarissimae cum Trebonio
complexusque: summae benevolentiae falsi indices exstiterunt in
amore simulato3 dexterae, quae fidei testes esse solebant, perfidia
sunt et scelere violatae: nocturnus introitus Smyrnam quasi in
hostium urbem, quae est fidissimorum antiquissimorumque socio-
rum: oppressus Trebonius, si ut ab eo qui aperte hostis esset, in-
cautus3 si ut ab eo qui civis etiam tum speciem haberet, miser.
Ex quo nimirum documentum nos capere fortuna voluit quid esset
victis extimescendum. Consularem hominem, consulari imperio
provinciam Asiam obtinentem, Samiario exsuli tradidit : interficere
captum statim noluit, ne nimis, credo, in victoria liberalis videretur.
Quum verborum contumeliis optimum virum incesto ore lacerasset,
tum verberibus ac tormentis quaestionem habuit pecuniae publicae
idque per biduum. Post cervicibus fractis caput abscidit, idque
affixum gestari jussit in pilo ε reliquum corpus tractum atque lania-
tum abjecit in mare. Cum hoc hoste bellandum est, cnjus taeterrima
crudelitate omnis barbaria superata est. Quid loquar de caede
civium Romanorum, de direptione fanorum? Quis est qui pro
rerum atrocitate deplorare tantas calamitates queat? Et nunc tota
Asia vagatur, volitat ut rex; nos alio bello distineri putat; quasi

vero non idem unumque bellum

falsi] Faernus proposed to erase ‘ falsi ’
and also ‘esse solebant,' and to read the
whole passage thus: ‘complexusque sum-
mae benivolentiae indices exstiterunt in
amore simulat03 dextraeque fidei testes
sunt perfidia et scelere violatae.’ 1 have
followed Halm in this passage. I doubt if
it is all right. Seb. Rau has proposed
⁴ secutae . . . . cum Trebonio. Complexus
qui sunt mutuae benevolentiae indices, falsi
exstiterunt in amore simulato!

Smyrnam] Halm has ⁸ Zmyrnam,’ and
the name was so written sometimes. V has
‘sedmyrnam,’ as Halm reports it. Mure-
tus gives the reading · Sdmyrnam,' which,
as he says, means Zmyrnam. The story of
Trebonius being seized by Dolabella at
Smyrna is told by Appian (B. C. iii. 26),
who says that a centurion cut off Trebonius'
head as soon as he was taken. At daybreak
Dolabella set up the head on the praetorian
seat, from which Trebonius had been used
to administer justice. lle was the first of
Caesar's assassins, says Appian, who paid
the penalty of his decds. Dion also (47.
c. 29), who tells the story of Dolabella’s
treacherous conduct towards Trebonius and
of the murder, says nothing of Trebonius

sit contra hoc jugum impiorum

being tortured.

SamiariO] Garatoni says, “ fortasse opi-
ficii genus denotat estque litera minuscula
scribendum ‘sumini-io) '’- ‘exsuli :' Momm-
sen proposes ‘ nescio cui.r V has ‘exul.'

quaestionem. . . pecuniae publicae] Do-
labella put him to the rack‚ as it is said
here, to find ont from him where the public
money was. 1 know not what else Cicero
can mean ; and yet one would suppose that
many persons must have known where it
waS. Perhaps however the governor had
concealed some of the money in Smyrna.

cervicibus ‚ji-aclis] D omits ⁴ fractis!
Trebonius was first strangled and'then his
head was cut off. The body was thr-own into
the sea. Appian (Β. C. iii. 26) says that
the soldiers insulted Trebonins' body, and
pitched his head from one to the other like
a ball in the pared streets of Smyrna, until
it could no longer be recognized. Appian
also says that Trebonius' remains were
brought to Rome, and that upon 11115 Dola-
bella was declared an enemy (iii. c. m).

alque laniatum] omitted in V.—· hoc
jugum :' this yoke of villains, a eonple of
them. He has already named them ‘ge-
minum in scelere par.’
