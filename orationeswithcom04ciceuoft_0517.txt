CA P. 15, 16. 495

audes, cujus me amicum, te sectorem esse fateare? XVI. Sed
omittatur bellum illud, in quo tu nimium felix fuisti. ‘Ne jocis
⁷ quidem respondebo, quibus me in castris usum esse dixistis> Erant
quidem illa castra plena curae3 verumtamen homines, quamvis in
turbidis rebus sint, tamen, si modo homines sunt, interdum animis
relaxantur. Quod autem idem maestitiam meam reprehendit, idem
J‘ocum‚ magno argumento est me in utroque fuisse moderatum.
Hereditates mihi negasti venire. Utinam hoc tuum verum cri-
men esset! plures amici mei et necessarii viverent. Sed qui istuc
tibi venit in mentem? Ego enim amplius sestertium ducenties ac-
ceptum hereditatibus rettuli. Quamquam in hoc genere fateor feli-
ciorem esse te. Me nemo nisi amicus fecit heredem, ut cum illo
commodo, si quod erat, animi quidam dolor jungeretur3 te is, quem
tu vidisti numquam, L. Rubrius Casinas fecit heredem. Et quidem
vide quam te amarit is qui albus aterne fuerit ignoras. Fratris filium
praeteriit; Q. Fufii, honestissimi equitis Romani suique amantis-
simi, quem palam heredem semper factitarat, ne nominat quidem3
te, quem numquam viderat aut- certe numquam salutaverat, fecit
heredem. Velim mihi dieas, nisi molestum est, L. Turselius qua
facie fuerit, qua statura, quo municipio, qua tribu. ‘Nihil scio,'
inquis, ‘ nisi quae praedia habuerit? Β Igitur fratrem exheredans te
faciebat heredem. In multas praeterea pecunias alienissimorum
hominum, vi ejectis veris heredibus, tamquam heres esset, in-
vasit. Quamquam hoc maxime admiratus sum, mentionem te

ceived, in my ‘ tabulae ’ or ‘codices accepti
et expensi ’ (Index Vol. i. ‘Acceptum’). The
neuter ⁴ acceptum ' refers to the whole sum

of Pompeius' property. As to ‘ sector ' see
Pro Sex. Roscio, c. 29, and the note.
16. Nejocis] ⁴ Ne de jocis‚' Wesenberg,

Halm 3 and the preposition is wanted. Plu-
tarch (Cicero, c. 38) speaks of Cicero joking
in Pompeius’ camp, and reports several of
his sayings. If this was all that he had to
say, it would have been better to stay away.
Macrobius (Sat. ii. c. 3) reports some of
these jokes. One of them is good. Pom-
peius asked Cicero where his son-in-law Do-
labella was, and Cicero replied, with your
father-in-law.

Hereditates] ‘ Hereditatem ’ Halm.
The meaning of this charge is that Cicero
was not respected or loved by any of his
friends who had died. A testamentary
gift was honourable to a man, and to be
entirely passed over by his friends was a
mark of disrespect. Cyrus, the architect,
left Cicero part of his estate ς and other tes-
tamentary gifts to Cicero are mentioned, as,
for instance, that of Diodotus (Ad Att. ii. 20).

sestertium ducenties] ‘Acceptum ret-
tu1i‚’1 have entered in my books as re-

as a unit.

Casinas] Of Casinum. Madvig “sec-it
heredem uncis inclusit” (Halm); which
Halm prudently does not follow.

fuerit] V. D., ⁸ ignoras‘ D. Halm. ‘ iy-
noraus V. sine puncto.’ The common
reading is ‘albus aterne fueris ignorans
fratris filium,’ δια-*11111113 aternet’ this
is as much as to say a person of whom
we know nothing. Abi-ami refers to Ca-
tullus (93) :

“ Nil nimium studeo, Caesar, tibi velle
placere,
Nec scire utrum sis albus an ater horno.''

Turselius] Some other man whom An-
tonius had never seen, and yet he had got
the man’s property, by force, as Cicero
says. ¹ Faciebat) as Halm renim-ks,1neans
that ⁴ he had a mind to make you his ll‹·1·es,'
as you say now that you have ἴοι-011111* got
possession. ⁴ Exlieredaus,' Index, Vol. ii.
