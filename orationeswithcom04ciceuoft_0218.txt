196 ORAT. IN L. CALPURNIUM PISONEM

caenarum conviviorumque genera, adulteria denique ejuS, delicatis-
simis versibus expresserit. In quibus si qui velit possit istius tam-
quam in speculo vitam intueri3 ex quibus inulta a multis lecta et
audita recitarem, ni vererer ne hoc ipsum genus orationis quo nunc
utor ab hujus loci more abhorreret3 et simul de ipso qui scripsit
detrahi nolo. Qui si fuisset, in discipulo comparando meliore for-
tuna, fortasse austerior et gravior esse potuisset3 sed eum casus
in hanc consuetudinem scribendi induxit philosopho valde indi'g-
nam, siquidem philosophia, ut fertur, virtutis continet et officii et*
bene vivendi disciplinam; quam qui profitetur gravissimam mihi
sustinere personam videtur. Sed idem casus illum ignarum quid
profiteretur, quum se philosophum esse diceret, istius impurissimae
atque intemperantissimae pecudis coeno et sordibus inquinavit.
Qui modo quum res gestas consulatus inei collaudasset—quae
quidem laudatio hominis turpissimi inihi ipsi erat paene turpis—
“non illa. tibi,” inquit, “invidia nocuit, sed versus tui.”——Nin1is
magna poena te consule constituta est sive malo poetae sive libero.
-“ Scripsisti enim: cedant arma togae.''——Quid tum? “Haec
res tibi fluctus illos excitavit.” At hoc nusquam opinor scriptum
fuisse in illo elogio, quod te consule in sepulcro rei publicae in-
cisum est, “velitis jubeatis, ut, quod M. Cicero versum fecerit:”
sed, “quod vindicarit? ,

XXX. Verum tamen, quoniam te non Aristarchum, sed
Phalarim grammaticum habemus, qui non notam apponas ad
malum versum, sed poetam armis persequare, scire cupio quid

gium’ is explained. The ‘ elogium ’ is Clo-

philosoplmm] The man, it seems, was
dius' Lex, by which the intel-dict was passed

by profession a philosopher, not knowing

what it was that he professed; by necessity,
a scribbler of obscene verses which Cicero
read.—‘ laudatio ε’ ⁴ collaudatio' V.‚ Halm.

Qui modu] Piso, the ‘ pecus‚' which was
a term of repmach, as we might call a man
a beast. The beast had made honourable
mention of Cicero’s consulship, and said
that it was not that unpopularity (illa in-
vidia) which did him damage, but his
verses. In place of ‘illa ' E. G. M. S. have
⁴ ulla! Cicero says the punishment that he
suffered was too much either for a bad poet
or a free man. Piso is supposed to con-
tinue what he had begun, ‘ scripsisti eni1n,'
Sec.

Cicero finally says, ‘⁴ But this Ι think
was never written in that inscription (elo-
gium) which in your consulship was cut on
the tomb of the state ε ¹ Velitis jubeatis . .
quod versum fecerit,’ but ‘quod vindicarit) '¹
See Vol. ii. Index, Elogium‚ where ‘ elo-

against Cicero in B.c. 58, the year of Piso’s
consulship; and ‘Velitis jubeatis ’ is the
beginning of the usual formula in enacting
a Lex. Manutius thinks that Clodius did
not use the words ⁴ quod vindicarit ' in his
Lex ; and nobody will suppose that he did.
Cicero uses a term which expresses the
reason for which he was banished, and at
the same time expresses a fact which he
did not wish to deny, that he had punished
the conspirator-S.

30. Aristarchus] This grammarian
marked with an obelisk those verses of
Homer which he judged to be spurious. ⁴
Cicero says (Ad Fam. iii. ll): ‘⁴ ut enim
Aristarchus Homeri versum negat quem
non probat‚” διο. His name became pro-
verbial: ¹· Fiet Aristarchus ” (Horace, Ars
Poet. 4.5Ο).-ι summum imperatorem ε’ Cn.
Pompeius, I think, as Hotmann says, and
not C. Caesar, which is Manutius’ opinion.
