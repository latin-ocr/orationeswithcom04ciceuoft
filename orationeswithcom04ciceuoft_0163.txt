voluntatis suae quam quum etiam accusatorem hujus mulcta et
poena mulctavit? potuit magis de re judicare quam quum ad
vestrum judicium cives amplissimos legavit, testes hujus juris, vitae
laudatores, periculi deprecat-ores? Etenim quis est tam demens
quin sentiat jus hoc Gaditanis esse retinendum, ne septum sit iis
iter perpetuo ad hoc amplissimum praemium civitatis, et magno
opere iis esse laetandum, hujus L. Cornelii benevolentiam erga suos
remanere Gadibus, gratiam et facultatem commendandi in hac
civitate versari? Quis enim nostrum est cui non illa civitas sit
hujus studio, cura, diligentia, commendatior? XIX. Omitto quantis
ornamentis populum istum O. Caesar, quum esset in Hispania
praetor, affecerit, controversias sedarit, jura ipsorum permissu
statuerit, inveteratam quondam barbariam ex Gaditanorum moribus
disciplinaque delerit, summa in eam civitatem hujus rogatu studia
et beneficia contulerit. Multa praetereo, quae quotidie labore
hujus et studio aut omnino aut certe facilius consequuntur. Itaque
et adsunt principes civitatis et defendunt; amore ut suum civem3

Madvig writes ‘ interponere indicium.' ‘ In- Gades was a ‘ foederata civitas.' It is con-
dicium-⁹ and ‘judicium' are often con· jectured that Caesar put an end to the

founded. Klotz has defended the expres-
sion ‘judicium interponere ' as one of Ci-
cer0⁷s expressions, which nobody will dis-
pute (see c. 23). But Baiter doubts if
‘judicium voluntatis' is a proper expres-
sion. I see no reason to doubt, though [
cannot find it elsewhere—⁴ multa et poena
notavit,' Baiter.

19. C. Caesar] C. Caesar was praetor in
Hispania Ulterior in ss.c. Gl and 60. Plu-
tarch (Caesar, c. ll) has a short notice of
Caesar’s government of Spain. He says:
‘⁴ After his military success he was equally
fortunate in settling the civil administra-
tion by establishing friendly relations among
the different states, and particularly by
hcaling the differenees between debtms and
creditors.” Suetonius (Caesar, 7) and Dion
Cassius (37, c. 52) say something about
Caesar's quaestor-ship in Spain, which was
perhaps in n.c. (58. Dion Cassius speaks of
Caesar being at Gades in his quaestorship
and also in his praetorship. His quaestor„
ship in Spain is alluded to in the last chap-
ter of the book on tlte Spanish war.

jura . . . statuerit] ‘ dura statum-eff like
‘ dare jura‚’ means to establish rules of law,
which Caesar did.—‘ ipsorum permissu,' for

human sacrifices at Gades, for this Phoeni-
cian colony probably followed this barban-om
practice, which seems so inconsistent wilh
the enter-prising and commercial character
of the Phoenician. But as the poet says

‘⁴ Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum.’'
(Lueretius i. 101.)

Aldus Nepos wrote ‘quandam’ foi-‘quon-
dam‚' and Lambinus also tliinkstliat ⁴ ‹luan-
dam' is right. Klotz thinks that ‘qnon-
dam' is better. because it removes the
origin of the barbarity, whatever it xvaS, to
a remoter period. There is some weiglit in
this remark. A barbarons practice lone
established, originating in times very re-
mote, and continued in coinpliance with
custom, is less a matter of reproach than · ει
certain barbarons practice inveterately rooted
in a people.’ We may assume that it wa<
something which all sensible people wished
to got rid of, that popular superstition mvl
ignor-anve opposed any change, and that
Caesar who was sagacious :md not snper-
stitious, helped to put an end to this prm*-
tice.

consequuntur] So it stands in some old
editions. Baiter hus ‘consmpiamm-.'
