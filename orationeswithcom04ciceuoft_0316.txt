294 ORAT. PRO O. RABIRIO POSTUMO

gere; urgere vero jacentes aut praecipitantes impellere certe est
inhumanum, praesertim, judices, quum sit hoc generi hominum
prope natura datum, uti, qua in familia laus aliqua forte floruerit,
hanc fere qui sunt ejus stirpis, quod sermo hominum ad memoriam
patrum virtute celebretur, cupidissime persequantur: siquidem non
modo in gloria rei militaris Paullum Scipio aut Maximum filius,
sed etiam in devotione vitae et in ipso genere mortis imitatus
est P. Decium filius. Sint igitur similia, judices, parva magnis.
ΙΙ. Fuit enim pueris nobis hujus pater C. Curtius, princeps ordinis
equestris fortissimus et maximus publicanus3 cujus in negotiis
gerendis magnitudinem animi non tam homines probassent, nisi in
eodem benignitas incredibilis fuisset, ut in augenda re non avaritiae
praedam, sed instrumentum bonitati quaerere videretur. Hoc ille
natus, quamvis patrem suum numquam viderat, tamen et natura
ipsa duce, quae plurimum valet, et assiduis domesticorum sermoni-
bus in paternae culpae similitudinem deductus est. Multa gessit ς
multa contraxit3 magnas partes habuit publicorum3 credidit po-

ejus stirpis . . . celebretur] The reading
of C. G. Halm has ‘ejus stirpis quam
sermo hominum ac memoria patrum vir-
tutem celebret,’ following Mommsen. The
passage is corrupt Cicero says that it is
natural for the member ofa family to follow
that pursuit which has ennobled a family.
It is one of his common places.—‘ P. De-
cium :' see Pro Sestio, c. 21, and the note
(Vol. iii.).

2. C. Curtius] The MSS. reading is
⁴ Curius.' Turnebus altered the name to
‘ Curtius,’ and Halm accepts it, and with-
draws his reading ‘ Curius’ in the Pro C.
Rabirio (c. 3, and the note, Vol. ii.), where
he would now have ‘Curtius’ Garatoni
defends ⁴ Curtius ' and refers to c. l7, where
the MSS. have ⁴ Curti,’ to Ad Att. ix. ‘2
and 5, and Ad Fam. xiii. 69.—‘princeps
ordinis equestris,’ &c.: see Pro Plancio, c.
13, ‘ princeps.' Halm changes ‘ fortissimus'
into ¹ fortunatissimus,’ which is an idle al-
teration. Lambinus and Hotmann pro-
posed ⁴ florentissimus‚’ which is no better.

Hoc ille] “ Immo llic illo vel illo hic,'’
Halm. Rabirius, we must suppose, was
born after his father’s death, and hence his
name Postumus.—‘eu1pae:’ the MSS.
reading. Hotmann changed it to ‘vitae,'
which Halm has accepted. Cicero says be-
low ‘vitam patris . . . expresserat) Manu·
tius suggests ‘ curae.' Abrami supposes
that Cicero says ⁶ culpae,’ not as expressing
his own opinion,but what his opponents said.

Multa yessil] So Cicero often says
‘negotium gerere ;’ and we have ‘nego-
tiorum gerens.⁷ There is no allusion here
to the ‘negotiorum gestio ’ (Dig. 3, tit. 5).
-‘ multa contraxitx’ he made many con-
tracts, which means that he was much en-
gaged in commerce. See Index, Vol. ii.

publicorum] ‘ publicanorum ' U„ the
only MS. quoted for this reading by Halm.
But ‘ publicorum ' is right. (De Domo, c.
28, note; Horace, Ep. i. ]. 76, ‘ conducere
publica.’) The Romans also said Publi-
cum (De Prov. Cons. c. 5, and the note).
The word occurs in Ulpian's definition of
the Publicani: ‘⁴ Publicani autem sunt
qui publico f1·uuntur” (Dig. 39. 4. l, 51).
The ‘publica' are the ‘vectigalia,’ which
were farmed by the societies of Publicani,
and Rabirius held many shares (partes) in
these undertakings. He was a busy money-
making man, who in our time would have
been a railway speculator and director, a
stock jobber, a loan contractor 3 a lender of
money to foreign states, to kings, and to
anybody, where there was a chance of pro-
fit. Rabirius had great influence. He got
men places as collectors (‘ mittere in nego-
tium :’ compare Pro Plancio, c. 19). He
gave them shares (partes) in undertakings.
He was a right royal jobber and direct0r3
and his name should be recorded as one of
the great men of ancient times, whose heroic
deeds still live before our eyes in modern
examples.
