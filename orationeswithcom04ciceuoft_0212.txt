190 ORAT. IN L. GALPURNIUM PISONEM

seres de triumpho: Quid tandem habet iste currus? quid vincti
ante currum duces? quid simulacra oppidorng quid aurum? quid
argentum? quid legati in equis, et tribuni? quid clamor militum?
quid tota illa pompa? Inania sunt ista, mihi crede, delectamenta
paene puerorum, captare plausus, vehi per urbem, conspici velle.
Quibus ex rebus nihil est quod solidum tenere, nihil quod referre
ad voluptatem corporis possis. Quin tu me vides, qui, ex qua pro-
vincia T. Flamininus, L. Paullus, Q. Metellus, Τ. Didius, innume—
rabiles alii, levi cupiditate commoti triumpharunt, ex ea sic redii ut
ad portam Esquilinam Macedonicam lauream conculcarim, ipse cum
hominibus quindecim male vestitis ad portam Caelimontanam sitiens
pervenerim ς quo in loco mihi libertus praeclaro imperatori domum
ex hac die biduo ante conduxerat, quae vacua si non fuisset, in
campo Martio mihi tabernaculum collocassem. Nummus interea
mihi, Caesar, neglectis ferculis triumphalibus domi manet et manebit.
Rationes ad aerarium continuo, sicut lex tua jubebat, detuli, neque
alia ulla in re legi tuae parui. Quas rationes si cognoris, ‘intelliges
nemini plus quam mihi litteras profuisse. Ita enim sunt perscriptae
scite et litterate, ut scriba, ad aerarium qui eas rettulit, perscriptis
rationibus, secum ipse, caput sinistra manu perfricans, commur-
muratus sit,

Ratio quidem hercle apparet, argentum οἴχεται.-

tulitin ‘triumpho . . . oppidorum simulacra
centum triginta quatuor.'’

flamininus] ‘Flaminius Codd. plerique’
(Halm), but Cicero is speaking of T. Quine-
tius Flamininus, one of those who had
triumphed for their Macedonian victories.

Esquilinam] Here he trampled on his
bays (laurea) gained in Macedonia, where
he had been saluted as Imperator; and then
he went to his lodging near the Caelimon-
tana: on which Manutius observes that
Piso entered by the Esquilina and then went
to the other gate. Cicero does not make
the man say that he entered by the Esqui-
lina.

em hac die biduo ante] A house or
lodging hired two days before his entering
the city, and the rent to be reckoned from
the day of his entry. All this dull talk is
to show what a mean fellow Piso was. But
he was a prudent man if he did not hire a
house before he wanted it.

ferculis] T. V. ‘vehiculis' C. ‘Fer-
cula’ are wooden frames on which things
were carried in the triumphal processions.
The gold and silver taken from the enemy
were displayed on these ‘ fercula) Piso says

that he kept his money at home. Caesar's
Lex contained regulations about the ac-
counts being given in to the treasury by a
governor on returning from his province.
-—‘ detuli ε’ V. Halm. ⁴ retuli‚⁷ Codd. rell.

litteras] ‘letters,' and ‘literature’ He
is playing on the word.—‘ ad aerarium :⁷ the
scriba who carried them to the treasury.
The words ‘perscriptis rationibus ’ are not
easily explained, and it has been proposed
to erase them, to which one would not ob-
ject, if any probable explanation could be
given of their appearance in the text, when
they ought not to be there.

The only part of this imaginary speech in
which there is any humour, is the picture of
the scriba who, after looking over the ac-
counts, scratches his head and says, The
reckoning is indeed plain enough, but the
money is gone. The line is from Plautus’
Trinummus (ii. 4. 17). V. S. have ‘ar-
gentum oechete,' the word οἴχεται being
represented by Roman characters. In an
old edition of Plautus (Venice, 1495) the
verse stands: “ ratio quidem hercle apparet
Argentum oechete.’'
