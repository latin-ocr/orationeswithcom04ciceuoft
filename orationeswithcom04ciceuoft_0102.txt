80 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO

dentiam singularem! Audctisne, quum ab ea muliere veniatis,
facere istorum hominum mentionem? audetisne excitare tanti
flagitii memoriam, non exstinctam illam quidem, sed repressam
vetustate? Quo enini illi crimine peccatoque perierunt? nempe
quod ejusdcm mulieris dolorem et injuriam Vettiano nefario stupro
sunt persecuti. Ergo, ut audiretur Vettii nomen in caussa, ut illa
vetus afraria fabula reficeretur, idcirco Camurtii et Gaesernii est
caussa renovata? qui, quamquam lege de vi certe non tenebantur,
eo maleficio tamen erant implicati ut ex nullius legis laqueis
emittendi viderentur. M. vero Caelius cur in hoc judicium vocatur?
cui neque proprium quaestionis crimen objicitur, nec vero aliquod
ejusmodi quod sit a lege sejunctum [et] cum vestra severitate con-
junctum: cujus prima aetas dedita disciplinis fuit iisque artibus,
quibus instituimur ad hunc usum forensem, ad capessendam rem
publicam, ad honorem, gloriam, dignitatem ε iis autem fuit amicitiis
majorum natu, quorum imitari industriam continentiamque maxime
velit, iis studiis aequalium, ut- eundem quem optimi ac nobilissimi
petere cursum laudis videretur. Quum autem paullum jam roboris
accessisset aetati, in Africam profectus est, Q. Pompeio proconsuli

part of the judices. ‘Sejungere' is often
used; as in c. 3, “tantum te a verborum

afraria] “ C. sed cod. St. Vict. araria ’⁹
(Halm). Aeraria, Garatoni, Halm; Afrania,

Orelli ; Afraniana, Lambinus. I do not
know what an ⁶ aeraria fabula ’ would mean.
‘ Afrania’ is a slight alteration ; but if
Afranius the comic writer is alluded to, the
word ought to be Afraniana. Garatoni ex—
plains his own emendation, which a man
ought to do. He says that Cicero is alluding
to the ‘quadrantes aerei‚’ and the story of
Clodia and her lover told by Plutarch
(Cicero, c. ⁶29), and referred to before. Ac-
cordingly it is the same as if Cicero had
said ‘ quadrantaria fabula.’ Orelli reads
⁴ fabula refricaretur,' but there is no autho-
rity for ‘refricaretun’ He quotes a like
use of ‘refricare ' from Phil. iii. 7.

emittendi] Codd. except A. which has
‘ eximendi,' which Halm accepts. ⁶ Laquei,'
the meshes of a net, are often used in met-a-
phors, to express a difficulty; as in Vcrr. ii.
2, c. 42: “Hic videte in quot se laqueos
induerit.’'

proprium quaestionis crimen] ‘ No
charge that was matter for a quaesti0.'—
‘ aliquod ' P. ‘sc crimen ’ (Halm). The other
reading is ⁴ aliquid.'—‘ a lege sejunctum :'
Gruter says that Leodegarius a Quercu
conjectures ‘quod non sit a lege’ διο. But
⁴ a lege sejunctum’ means any thing which
is at variance with a Lex and consequently
consistent with severity on your part, the

libertate sejungas;” and in c. 32, “num-
quam hunc a nostris rationibus sejunctum
fore.''—‘ disciplinis ε’ ¹ disciplinae,’ Halm.

instituimur] P. E. G. S.‚ the usual word
in such a case. There is little authority for
⁴ instruimur‚’ which is printed in many edi-
tions—⁴ maxime velit τ’ some editions have
incorrectly ⁶ vellet,’ which Ernesti intro-
duced, on account of the difference of tense
in the two members of the sentence. But, as
Garatoni says, “ velit optantis est.’'——-‘ iis
aequalium studiis ε’ his ‘ aequales ' or com—
panions in age are opposed to his elders (ma-
jorum natu), and ‘studiis ' is opposed to
‘ amicitiis! The MSS. have ‘iis aequalium
studiis ' except A. 3 which has the order in
the text, and this order corresponds to
‘ amicitiis majorum natu,’ and so the oppo-
sition is complete. But the exact meaning
is not so clear. In c. 17 he says “ non
quies, non remissio, non aequalium studia,
non ludi, non convivia delectarent ;” where
it means such ‘ pursuits as his aequales
have) Accordingly this passage should
mean ‘that he had such friendship with his
elders—such pursuits in common with his
aequales,’ that is, he had the same pur-suits
as they had, and accordingly was considered
to be in the same honourable career.
