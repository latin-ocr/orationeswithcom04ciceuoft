8 ORAT. IN l'. VATINIUM TESTEM

ΙΙΙ. Nam quod mihi discessum objecisti meum, et quod horum,
quibus ille dics acerbissimus fuit, qui idem tibi laetissimus, luctum
et gemitum renovare voluisti, tantum tibi respondeo, me, quum tu
ceteraeque rei publicae pestes armorum caussam quaereretis, ct
quum per meum nomen fortunas locupletium diripere, sanguinem
principum civitatis exsorbere, crudelitatem vestram odiumque diu-
turnum, quod in bonos jam inveteratum habebatis, saturare cupe-
retis, scelus et furorem vestrum cedendo maluisse frangere quam
resistendo. Quare peto a te ut mihi ignoscas, Vatini, quum ei
patriae pepercerimquam servaveram3 et, si ego te perditorem et
vexatorem rei publicae fero, tu me conservatorem et custodem feras.
Deinde ejus viri discessum increpas, quem vides omnium civium
desiderio, ipsius denique rei publicae luctu esse revocatum? At
enim dixisti, non mea sed rei publicae caussa homines de meo reditu
laborasse. Quasi vero quisquam vir excellenti animo in rem pub-
licam ingressus optabilius quidquam arbitretur quam se a suis
civibus rei publicae caussa diligi. Scilicet aspera mea natura,
difficilis aditus, gravis vultus, superba responsa, insolens vita3 nemo
consuetudinem meam, nemo humanitatem, nemo consilium, nemo
auxilium requirebat, cujus desiderio, ut haec minima dicam, forum

Ciceronis, ii. 3). In the word ‘ vaticinando,’
as Hotmann observes, Cicero is playing on

If any one has listened to a modern speaker,
he will often find two words of like signifi-

the name, of Vatinius.

3. discessum] Cicero’s leaving Rome
when he was threatened by Clodius.
Vatinius charged him with being afraid,
as Goveanus supposes, but Halm observes
that Vatinius meant his leaving Rome to be
taken as a proof of Cicero's unpopularity3
which is the better opinion. See Pro Sestio,
c. 22.—⁴ horum ι’ all the whole people in the
court, judices and hearers.

pestes] P. Clodius, A. Gabinius, L. Piso,
and their faction.—-‘ per meum nomen :'
‘ using my name as a pretext!

quum ei patriae] A. has ‘ quum et,'
which seems to be intended for ‘ quum ei,'
and also ⁴ pepercissem) Madvig alters the
passage thus, ⁶ quod ei patriae peperci,'
saying “huic enim ipsi tamquam peccato
ignosci Cicero vult, non propter eam causam
ignosci nescio cui rei.'’ Hermann writes
⁴ quum ei patriae peperci‚’ and Halm follows
him.

perditorem et vexatorem] The weaker
word as it is called is placed after the
stronger. Halm observes that when two or
more words are put together to increase the
force of the expression, the proper order

cation used, and the weaker word placed
second; but this is a proof of the speaker's
weakness. It is common to see this order
of words in writing too, and for the same
reason. The writer does not exactly know
what he is saying. Cicero may have known
what he was talking about. He calls
Vatinius a ‘ perditor rei publicae,' one who
would have ruined the state, if he could;
and Cicero had saved the state at a criti-
cal time. He was the ⁴ conservator‚’
while Vatinius was the ⁴ perditor.' Again,
after this attempt to be a ‘ perditor,'
Vatinius was a ‘vexator rei publicae‚' a
turbulent fellow, and Cicero was a ‘custos‚'
a guardian, a protector. For he does not
call himself ‘cust0s‚' because he retired
from Rome to avoid the conflict‚ as Garatoni
supposes, which would be a strange kind of
⁴ custodia ;’ but because of his present dis·
position towards the state he calls himself
‘ custo& as Hermann says.

vir excellenti animo] ⁶ a man ofa good
disposition.’—‘insolens vita :’ ‘ arrogantiae
plena ’ (Abrami).

cujas desiderio] The Scholiast thinks
that Cicero speaks rather arrogantly. But

is not always observed. This may be so. it was his fashion. See Pro Sestio, c. 60.
