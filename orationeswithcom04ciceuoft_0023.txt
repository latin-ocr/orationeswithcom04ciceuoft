IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

ORATIO.

INTRODUOTION.

P. VATINIUS was a man of mean origin, as Cicero tells us, and Velleius
(ii. (59) says the same. He was also disfigured by some deformities‚
which Cicero with his usual bad taste in such matters often reminds him
of 3 and his moral character was as bad as his personal appearance. He
was quaestor in ΒΛ). 63 (c. 5), and in the next year he went to Hispania
Ulterior as legatus to O. Cosconius (e. 5). In ΒΑ). 59, the year of C.
Caesar’s consulship, he was a tribunus pl„ and he served Caesar faith-
fully in all his measures. He was the man who proposed the Rogatio
which gave Caesar after his consulate the Provinees of Gallia Citerior
and Illyricum with three legions ; to which the senate added Gallia. Nar-
bonensis with one legion. Caesar repaid Vatinius for his services by
making him one of his legati, and it appears that he left Rome (13.c. 58)
for his provincia, but returned on hearing that he was threatened with a.
prosecution under the Lex Licinia et J unia on account of the Roga-
tiones which he had proposed in his tribunate. It appears from what
we learn of him in Cicero, and from his never being mentioned in the
Commentaries of Caesar before the year ne. 51 (B. G. viii. 46), that ho
stayed at Rome several years, partly to look after his own interests, and
perhaps also to look after Caesar's3 for he was always on good terms
with his old master, who afterwards employed him in the Civil XVar.
Vatinius was a candidate for the aedileship probably in 13.o. 57, but he
lost his election (e. 15). In nc. 56 he was one of the witnesses against
P. Sestius, whom Cicero defended; and in this same year he was a can-
didate for the praetorship, and brought himself within the penalties of
the Lex Tullia de Ambitu by exhibiting a show of gladiators. C. Lici-

nius Calvus threatened him at this time with a prosecutiou. 'rho
