OAP. 19—21. 143

virum summa virtute praeditum, civitate donavit, quum Camertinum
foedus sanctissimum atque aequissimum sciret esse. Potest igitur,
judices, L. Cornelius condemnari ut non C. Marii factum condem-
netur? Exsistat ergo ille vir parumper cogitatione vestra, quoniam
re non potest, ut conspiciatis eum mentibus quem oculis non potestis :
dicat se non imperitum foederis, non rudem exemplorum, non
ignarum belli fuisse: se P. Africani discipulum ac militem; se
stipendiis,> se legationibus bellicis eruditum; se, si tanta bella
legisset, quanta ‘gessit et confecit, si tot consulibus meruisset,
quoties ipse consul fuisset, omnia jura belli perdiscere ac nosse
potuisse; sibi non fuisse dubium quin nullo foedere a re publica
bene gerenda impediretur: a se ex conjunctissima atque amicissima
civitate fortissimum quemque esse delectum: neque Iguvinatium
neque Camertium foedere esse exceptum, quo minus eorum civibus
a populo Romano praemia virtutis tribuerentur. XXI. Itaque
quum paucis annis post hanc civitatis donationem acerrima de
civitate quaestio Licinia et Mucia lege venisset, num quis eorum,

ma virtute:’ ‘summa' was added by Gry-
phius. After ‘ civitate donavit ' Halm prints
in italics ‘idem cohortes duas universas
Camertium civitate donavit,' which Madvig
has proposed on the authority of what is
said in this chapter and in the twenty-second.

Camerinum was a town in the north of
Umbria near the frontiers of Picenum. The
foedus of the Romans and the Camertes is
mentioned by Livy (28, 6. 45) who says
their ‘foedus ’ was ‘ aequum.' Menippus
one of the legati of Antiochus (Livy, 34, 6.
57) divides ⁴ foedera' into three classes or
kinds, which he describes. Osenbrueggen
(p. 87) does not accept Menippus' division.
He divides ‘foedera’ into ‘aequa’ and ‘non
aequa.' He gives as an example of an
‘ aequum foedus ' the foedus of the Romans
and the Latini (Α.υ.6. 261) and the
foedus of the Romans and the Hernici
(Dionys. vi. 95; Liv. ii. 33, 41). 116 says:
“ Unless those foedera had been altogether
aequa, the Latini would not have demanded
that at Rome 0116 60115111 should be a Roman,
and the other a Latin, so that they should
make one people with Rome as the capital.
On the rejection of this demand by the
Romans, war began, aud on the termination
of the war 1116 Latini having the inferiority,
the old Latin constitution was dissolved,
and in place of the ⁴ aequum foedus.’ which
1116 Latini had, they were compelled to sur-
render '’ (iu deditionem venerunt).

non iynarnm belli] ⁴ uon ignarum bellici
juris,’ Halm, Baiter. P. has ‘ belli * *.’

The other MSS. quoted by Baiter have
‘belli.’—‘legisset:' “ leyissel ed. Aldina.
eqisset C.'’ (Baiter). Yet some editions of
Cicero have still ⁴ egisset,' a word without a
meaning here—‘si tot consulibus meruisset?
‘if he had only sei-ved under consuls as
many in number as the number of his own
consulships.’ In place of ⁴ consul fuisset ’

Abrami proposed ‘ consul fuit,' in order 10 “

make the tense the same as ‘gessit’ and
⁰ confecit 3' and there is no good reason why
the tenses should not be 1116 same.

Jyuviaatiaemz] The Iguvinates were 1116
people of Iguvium (Gubbio) iu Umbria.
ln place os ‘ Iguvinatium ’ Lambinus read
‘ Fulginatium,' for which there is probably
110 MSS. authority. 1¹¹. G¹. E. have ⁸ igui-
natium,’ which is clearly a corruption of
‘ Iguvinatium)

21. Licinia et Mucia] This was a Lex
enacted in the consulship ot' L. Licinius
Crassus the Orator aud Q. Mucius Scaevola
Pontifex Maximus, whom Cicero (Dc off.
iii. ll) calls ⁴ sapientissimi consules) The
object of this Lex was to prevent those
Italians from actiug as Roman citizens who
were not Roman citizens Ast-onius (ln
Cornel. p. 67) says this Lex was 0116 ot* the
chief causes of the Italic war, which began
three years aster. In 1116 passage in the
Pro Sestio. 6. 13, “ Nihil acerbius so‹·ii.''
&c. the Schol. adds, ‘⁸ llujusmodi leges
ferri dicebantur 116 civibus redigendis, qua-
lem tulerat L. Licinius Crassus 61 Q· MU-
