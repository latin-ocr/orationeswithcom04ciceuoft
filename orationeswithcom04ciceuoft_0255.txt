Quare aut redde mihi quod ostenderas, aut, si, quod mea

Sed amplissimos honores ut pro

supplicare.

VI. Haec populi oratio est3 mea vero, Laterensis, haec: Quare
victus sis non debere judicem quaerere, modo ne largitione sis victus.
Nam si, quotiescumque praeteritus erit is qui non debuerit prae-
teriri, toties oportebit eum qui factus erit condemnari, nihil jam est
quod populo supplicetur, nihil quod diribitio, nihil quod [supplicatio
magistratuum] renuntiatio suffragiorum exspectetur-3 simul ut qui

amplissimos honores] The praetorship
and consulship, the regular road to which
was through the curule aedileship. XVunder
compares Cicero De Legg. iii. 3: ‘⁴ Sunto-
que aediles, coeratores urbis, annonae lu-
dorumque solemnium: ollisque ad honoris
amplioris gradum is primus ascensus csto.''
See also what he says of the duties of the
curule aediles when he was ⁴ aedilis
designatus.’ (Verr. ii. 5. c. 14. Vol. i.)

6. diribitio . . . exspectetur] This pas-
sage, says Wunder, is thus written in all
the MSS„ except that instead of ⁴ diribitio’
the inferior MSS. have ‘ direptio ;’ one has
‘directio,' and another has ‘diremptio'
The words ⁴ supplicatio magistratuum ' seem
entirely out of place, as will appear clearcr
when the meaning of ‘diribitio’ is esta-
blished. Baiter includes ⁸ suffragiorum'
also in [ ], following Garatoni's opinion,
who thought that it ought to be erased.
Wunder thinks that ⁴ suffragiorum’ is ne-
cessary, but I doubt if he is right. If
‘renuntiatio' means ‘suffragiorum renun-
tiatio‚' then ‘suffragiorum' is necessary.
But ⁴ renuntiare’ means the formal declara-
tion of the names of the successful can-
didates (Pro Murena, c. l), and 1 do not
know if it is applied to ⁴ suffragia) (See
the note on c. ⁶20, ‘renuntiatae.') If we
omit ‘suffragiorum' Cicero must use ¹ rc-
nuntiatio’ in the sense which it has in the
passage Pro Murena: and this will be con-
sistent with what follows. If rank must.
decide the cleotinus. there is no need of an
election, nor of a formal declaration of the
successful eaudidates' names.

Wunder has a long dissertation on the
verb ¹‹lii·il›ere.’ and the, noun ‘diribitio'
(Variae. Lectiones. &c.). lle concludes
with what he might have. placed first, tho
etymology ot' ⁴di1·il)ere.' Tho word is con-
pounded ot' ⁴ dis ' or ⁴ dir ¹ aud ⁴ habech in
which eompound the Ιι is omitted, as it is in

‘praebere' (praehabere), and in ‘debere '
(dehabere). There is also ⁴cohibere,’ which
means ‘to hold together,' and accordingly
⁴ diribere ' should mean ‘to hold apart,’ ⁴ to
separate.⁷ Wunder remarks that with the
exception of Abrami, the commentator,-
have taken ‘diribere’ to mean the same as
⁴ distribuere‚' when it is applied to voting at
the ‘comitia' or at trinis. Ile gives the
opinions of these critica at great length, and
they are very tedious to read. One passage
of Cicero (Frag. Or. Corn. i.); as it is
printed in Ernesti’s edition, contains the
words ‘ dum tabellae dii-il)entur‚’ and this
passage has been used to show that ⁴ diri-
bentur’ means ‘distrilmuntur.' unt the
words are a pure invention of Patricius,
who thought that they were necessary.

The passages cited by &Vnnden in which
‘diribere’ and ‘diribitio’ occur, are the
following : Pro Plancio, cc. 6. 20; In
Pisonem, ce. 15, 4ος Quum Senatui, c. ll ς
Cicero, Ad Q. Fr. iii. 43 Varro, De R. R.
iii. 2 and 5; and Valerius Maximus, ix. c.
12, ξ 7 ; besides a few other passages from
later writers. &Vunder says that in all these
passages the best and oldest Mss, have the
readings ‘diribere' or ‘diribitor3' and that
all the inferior and more recent MSS. hau·
either some word by which these words are
usually explained or some corrupted form
of them. In the passage in the Iu Pisonem.
c. 40, however, the MSS. have ¹ diripianun·.'
a word without any meaning there. ¹ Diri-
beantur¹ in that passage, says Wunder. i<
a conjecture of Turnebus. Adv. xxi. 15.
Whethcr it is Turnebus’ conjecture ‹vr-
another's (see the note In l‘ison. c. 40) i<
immaterinl. The. conjecture is certainly
right. In the epistle. to Quintus· u'nndvr
observes that. all the Mss. have *dirupti-2·
and as this word gives no sense. we have
to choosc between writing ‘diremptis' υτ·
¹ diribitis.’ Iu the passage of Varro tiit. 2)
