PRO GN. PLANCIO

ORATIO.

INTRODUCTION.

CICERO in this oration (c. 11) has given a sketch of the life of his client
Cn. Plancius. In his youth Plancius was with A. Torquatus in Africa3
and he afterwards served in Crete under Q. Metellus Creticus in the
Cretan war, which began in 13.c. 69 and ended in Rc. 67. He served
in Macedonia as tribunus militum, and he was afterwards quaestor under
L. Apuleius in the same province, while Cicero was in exile (13.c. 58,
57; Pro Plancio, c. 11, 41).

Cicero, writing to his brother (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 1) in the month of De-
cember Rc. 5¹7, mentions Racilius and Cn. Plancius among the tribunes
elected for the following year3 and in another letter to Quintus (ii. 6),
written the next year, he speaks of Racilius as one of the tribunes (Pro
Plancio, c. 11 and 32). Accordingly the tribunate of Plancius was iu
the year B.c. 56; and he could not be a candidate for the aedileship
before 13.c. 55, nor exercise the office of aedile before Bc. 54.

This explanation is necessary for the purpose of showing in what year
Cicero delivered this oration. In B.c. 54 Cicero defended P. Vatinius
against a charge made under the Lex de Sodaliciis (L. Domitio Aheno-
barbo Appio Claudio Pulchro Coss„ Ascon. Ad Scaur. p. 121), aud as he
delivered the oration for Plancius after the oration for Scaurus, this
oration must have been delivered either in 13.c. 54 or after that year, and
not in 13.c. 55, as some critics have said. Cicero, in a letter to his bro-
ther (Ad Qu. Fr. iii. 1. iw), says, “ I have finished the orations which
you have demanded of me Pro Scauro and Pro Plancio.” This letter was
written in B.c. 54, as the contents clearly show, and either at tho end οῖ’
September or the beginning of October. Further‚ we know that Cicero
spoke for P. Vatinius in August 13.c. 54, and that Scaurus' trial was to
come on immediately aster (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 16). The conclusion then is,
