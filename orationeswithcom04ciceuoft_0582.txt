INTRODUOTION ΤΟ ΤΗΕ FIFTH PHILIPPIO. .

THIs speech was delivered on the lst of J anuary, Rc. 43, the day on
which the new consuls Hirtius and Pansa entered on their office. The
matter which they brought before the senate was the siege of Mutina by
M. Antonius, the general state of the commonwealth, and the rewards
and honours for those who had served the state by opposing Antonius.
These were the matters on which a SC. had been made in the preceding
month (Aa). XIII Kal. J an.). The senator, whose opinion had been first
asked, proposed that they should send commissioners to Antonius to
tell him to relinquish the siege of Mutina. Cicero opposed the sending
of commissioners to treat of peace with a man whom they had in fact
declared to be an enemy by their resolutions of the XIII Kal. Jan.
(Phil. iii.). Cicero strongly urged the senate to come to no terms with
Antonius, but to treat him as an enemy to the state; and to grant to
the generals and the soldier-s who had served against Antonius the
honours and rewards which it had been already proposed ‘to give them.
The senate came to no decision on the lst of J anuary, but three days
after they determined to send commissioners to Antonius.
