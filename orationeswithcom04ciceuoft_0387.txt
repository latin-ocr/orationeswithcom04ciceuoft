profecto illa vis, neque in his corporibus atque in hac imbecillitate
nostra inest quiddam quod vigeat et sentiat, [et] non inest in 1100
tanto naturae tam praeclaro motu: nisi forte idcirco esse non pu-
tant quia non apparet nec cernitur; proinde quasi nostram ipsam
mentem, qua sapimus, qua providemus, qua haec ipsa, agimus ac
dicimus, videre aut plane qualis aut ubi sit sentire possimus. Ea
vis igitur ipsa, quae saepe incredibiles huic urbi felicitates atque
opes attulit, illam perniciem exstinxit ae sustulit, cui primum men-
tem injecit, ut vi irritare ferroque lacessere fortissimum virum au-
deret vincereturque ab eo, quem si vicisset, habiturus esset impuni-
tatem et licentiam sempiternam. Non est humano consilio, ne
mediocri quidem, judices, deorum immortalium cura res illa per-

fecta.

which Cicero could handle in his closet, but
it is out of place here. He might have
assumed the existence of gods without try-
ing to prove it. His argument is that there
is something in these frail bodies which
lives and has intelligence, and so we may
conclude that there is something of the
same kind and greater in the great move-
ments of nature. Voltaire, who defended
Deism against Athcism, has the same argu-
ment.—‘ nisi forte! In the same way So-
crates answers the objections of Aristode-
mus (Mem. i. c. 4) ; and Cicero, translating
the Cyropaedia (De Sen. c. 22), has the same
argument: we must not deny the existence
of a ‘ mens,’ because we cannot see it. We
- cannot deny the existence in some sense of
a thing, whatever we name it, when we
speak of what this thing does or causes, for
the form of language, and that is the form
of thought, contains the admission impli-
citly. Some of the ancient philosophers
tried to determine in what part of the body
the ‘ mens' resided. Sensibly enough they
did not put it in any part of the body, of
which a man can be deprived and still can
live. Pythagoras placed the intellect in
the head, and if it is in any part of the
body, it is certainly there, aa the language
of all mankind shows.
mentem injecit] The providence of the
Deity was manisested in leading Clodius to
his ruin, “ a thought osten expressed by 1110
ancients, of a deep moral import ” (Halm).

quoted in Vol iii„ In Cat. iii. c. 9. 1 suppose
that he does not mean ⁴ moral ’ as opposed to
‘imm(›1·al.' but ‘moral ' in the sense of what
relates to the character of actions generally.
If 110 means what l do not suppose him to
mean, he has a very immoral meaning.

Religiones mehercule ipsae, quae illam belluam eadere

The man who believes this doctrine, know-
ing that he may be the sport of such malig-
nity, makes no resistance to temptation.
When 110 has done that which he is led to
do, as he believes, and at the same time
what he knows that he ought not to have
done, he comforts himself with saying that
it is not his work, but 1110 work of the
power which compelled 111111; and his rea-
soning is a just conclusion from his false
opinions. But the doctrine of Cicero, the
‘thought of a deep moral import,' does
often appear even now, and hardly disguised.

Reliyiones] “ The holy places; the
temples, altars, and ceremonies established
in them’' (Abrami).—‘Vos enim . . . so-
ciae et aequales:' quoted by Quintilian,
xi. l, 34. The ‘Albani tumuli’ are the
Alban hius. It was an old tradition that
Alba was destroyed by the Roman king
Tullus Hostilius. The altars which Clo<
dius destroyed may have been rhetorical
altarS, which would harmonize well with
the rest of the passage. There may be an
allusion bere to the Feriae Latinae, which
were celebrated on the Mons Albanus (l‘ro
Plancio, c. 9). Abrami quotes two lines
srom Cicero⁷s poem 011 his consulship:

‘¹ Tu quoque quum tumulos Albano in
