OAP. 5—7. 95
leribus flagitiisque contaminatissimo nihil esse credendum; deinde a
proditore, atque eo quem praesentem hostem rei publicae cognosset,
bene rem publicam geri non potuisse : postremo ne deos quidem 1111-
* mortales velle aperiri sua templa et sibi supplicari hominis impurissimi
et sceleratissimi nomine. Itaque ille alter aut ipse est homo doctus
et a suis Graecis subtilius eruditus, quibuscum jam in exostra
helluatur, antea. post siparium solebat, aut amicos habet pruden-
tiores quam Gabinius, cujus nullae litterae proferuntur.

VII. Hosce igitur imperatores habebimus? quorum alter non au-
det nos certiores facere, ne imperator appelletur : alterum, si tabellarii
non cessarint, necesse est· paucis diebus poeniteat audere. Cujus
amici si qui sunt, aut si belluae tam immani tamque taetrae possunt
ulli esse amici, hac consolatione utuntur, etiam T. Albucio suppli-
cationem hunc ordinem denegasse. Quod est primum dissimile,
res in Sardinia cum mastrucatis latrunculis a propraetore una
cohorte auxiliaria gest-a, et bellum cum maximis Syriae gentibus

[et] tyrannis consulari exercitu imperioque confectum. Deinde

An ‘ exostra' is explained to be a stage
machine, which is moveable on wheels, so
that what is going on inside may be shown
to the spectators. A · siparium ’ is a cur-
tain. Piso now revels in public· with his
Greeks, though before 110 used to go behind
a curtain. Piso was either wise enough to
send no despatches, as Gabinius had done,
or he had friends wiser than himself, who
kept them back (In Pison. c. 17). Decimus
Brutus, in a letter to Cicero (xi. 19, referred
to by Abrami) says: “Ad senatum quas
literas misi velim prius perlegas, et si qua
tibi videbuntur commutes.''

7. facere, ne imperator] The common
reading is ‘ facere ne imperator.’ P1. E.
omit ‘ne.’ See In Pison. c. 16. Ant. Augus-
tinus proposed ‘ facere cur imperator,' a bad
alteration ; and Halm proposes ‘ facere num
imperator,’ which is worse. If the text is
right, Cicero says that Piso dares not send
us a despatch, for sear of being entitled Im-
perator; which was indeed the very thing
that he wanted, but Cicero is joking, rather
heavily however. For there is little point
in saying that Piso does not darc to write
10 us for fear of being addressed as Impera-
tor.’

dinia, when he had this humiliation.

Quod est primum dissimile] G. E. ‘ Quid >

this alteration is founded 011 a misunder-
standing of the text, which means ‘now
this (quod) in the first place is quite a dif-
ferent thing. an affair (res),’ ἃς. He then
says ‘deinde Albucius.'—· mastrucatis :’ a
mastruca or mastruga was a course dress of
skins, which the Sardinians wore, and wear
still iu some parts of the island, a cloak or
jacket of undressed sheep or goats' skins

with the fleece outside. Strabo (Lib. v. p.

22 5) also mentions this practice. Hoc asys

“that there are rams in Sardinia 11111111 huic
goats’ hair instead of wool, and are 1111111 l
musmones: iu the skins 01 these animal„-
they defend themselves.” 110 is speaking
of the mouflon or musmon, which has large
horns, and lives in Corsica, Sardinia, und
some other places.
