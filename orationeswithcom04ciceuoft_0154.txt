132 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

enim sine caussa de Cn. Publicio Menandro, libertino homine, quem
apud majores legati nostri in Graeciam proficiscentes interpretem
secum habere voluerunt, ad populum latum est, ut is Publicius, si
domum revenisset et inde Romam rediisset, ne minus civis esset.
Multi etiam superiore memoria cives Romani sua voluntate, 111-
demnati et incolumes, his rebus relictis, alias se in civitates con-
tulerunt.

XII. Quod si civi Romano licet esse Gaditanum sive exsilio
sive postliminio sive rejectione hujus civitatis—ut jam ad foedus*
veniam, quod ad caussam nihil pertinet, de civitatis 0111111 jure, non
de foederibus disceptamus—quid est quamobrem civi Gaditano in
hanc civitatem venire non liceat? Equidem longe secus sentiO.
Nam quum ex omnibus civitatibus via sit in nostram, quumque
nostris civibus pateat ad ceteras iter civitates, tum vere, ut quaeque

‘ postliminio' if he returned home. If a civis, et ideo esset lex supervacua.”

man who had been captured by an enemy, lzz's rebus relictis] The MSS. have ‘iis ‘
returned home, it was a legal fiction that he and ‘ his! Halm proposes ‘ suis ' in place
had always been at home, and a clear con· of ¹ his‚' which Baiter has injudiciously ac-
sequence, if such a fiction was accepted as cepted. ‘ His rebus’ means Rome and all
a fact, that he was still a citizen. There that is in it. So Cicero says in a letter 10

was a difference of opinion about the ety-
mology of Postliminium (Cicero, Top. c.
8). Plutarch has 311 explanation of the
Postliminium, after his fashion (Quaest.
Rom. 5). Cicero gives the word another
sense. He applies it to the case of a man,
who had by his own act ceased to be the
citizen of 3 state, and subsequently resumed
his original political condition ‘ postliminio,'
that is, by returning and claiming it, we must
suppose.

sine caussa] But there seems no rea-
son at all; for how could a man lose
his Roman ‘civitas’ by returning to his
former city, if he returned without the
intention of resuming his former condition ?
And this was the opinion of Pomponius
(Dig. 49. 15. 5, §3): “ Captivus autem, si
a nobis manumissus fuerit et pervenerit ad
suos, ita demum postliminio reversus intel-
* ligitur, si malit 005 sequi quam in nostra
civitate manere, et ideo in Atilio Regulo,
quem Carthaginienses Romam miserunt, re-
sponsum est non esse eum postliminio re-
versum, quia juraverit Carthaginem se re-
versurum et non habuerat animum Romae
remanendi. Et ideo in quodam interprete
Menandro, qui posteaquam apud nos manu-
missus erat missus est ad suos, non est visa
necessaria lex quae lata est de illo, ut ma-
neret civis Romanus3 nam sive animus ei
fuisset remanendi apud suos, desineret esse
civis, sive animus fuisset revertendi maneret

Quintus (i. l, 0. 5) : “ Quamobrem qui
potes reperire ex eo genere hominum, qui
pecuniae cupiditate adducti careant iis re-
bus omnibus, a quibus nos divulsi 0550 non
possumuS,’' &c., where ‘iis rebus omnibus'
means Rome and all that is in it.

12. eoesz'lz'e] See Pro Caecina, 0. 34, and
Cicero’s remarks there on ‘exsilium.’ The
‘postliminio' can only ‚be explained thus.
Cicero is speaking of a Gaditanus, who had
become a Roman citizen, and such a Gadi-
tanus could become a Gaditanus again by
returning to Gades with the intention of
again becominga citizen of Gades. A Roman
citizen might then become 3 Gaditanus either
by retiring to Gades in ‘exsilium,’ or by
returning to Gades (postliminio) if he was
originally a Gaditanus3 or by giving up
(rejectione) the Roman civitas and taking
that of Gades.

ex* omnibns civitatibus] Rome grew great
by opening her doors to the people of other
states.—‘ societate, amicitia,' &c. 05011-
brueggen (p. ⁸3) remarks on these ternis
that they are the words of the orator, and
they do not contain an enumeration of the
various kinds of relationship established
between other people and the Romans, but
merely express what he has said before (c. (5):
“ praestabilem esse scientiam in foederibus,
pactionibus, conditionibuS, populorum, re-
gum, exterarum nationum, in universo
denique belli jure ac pacis.''
