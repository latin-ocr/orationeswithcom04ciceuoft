270 ORAT. PRO CN. PLANCIO

esset quemquam praeteriri, statuissemque eos solum nominare, qui

gratias egi. Recitetur oratio, quae propter rei magnitudinem dicta
de scripto est; in qua ego homo astutus ei me dedebam, cui nihil
magno ‘opere deberem, et hujus tanti officii servitutem astringebam
testimonio sempiterno. Nolo cetera quae a me mandata sunt lit-
teris recitare : praetermitto ne aut proferre videar ad tempus, aut
eo genere uti litterarum, quod meis studiis aptius quam consuetu-
dini judiciorum esSe videatur.

XXXI. Atque etiam elamitas, Laterensis: “ Quousque ista
dicis? Nihil in Cispio profecisti. Obsoletae jam sunt preces
tuae.” De Cispio mihi igitur objicies, quem ego de me bene meri-

Plancius in the Quum Senatui. He is a

—‘ de scripto est:’ written and read, as
was the Roman practice sometimes. (Pro
Sestio, c. 61, aud the note. Wunder refers
also to Phil. i. 13 x. 2.) Perhaps all the
Greek and Roman orations which remain
have been carefully revised after delivery3
and many of them were prob'ably written
before they were delivered. The facile art
of standing up and pouring out words was
certainly not much valued by the ancient
orators, nor by their hearers. Accordingly
an oration was a thing well prepared and
rehearsed, and sometimes written to be
read only.

Wunder remarks that Cicero reminds the
Judices of this being a written speech, in
order to obviate the objection that what he
had said of Plancius in that oration had
been added since, and for the present occa-
sion (temporis caussa).

Nolo cetera] This ⁴ oratio habita in se-
natu‚’ or c. 14, was read. The other things
which he kindly spares the Judices the
trouble of hearing are conjectured by the
critics to be his three books ‘de con-
sulatu3' and it is further supposed that
these books contained the story of his
exile and his return, as he calls them “ tres
libros de temporibus meis” (Ad Div. i. 9).

mentionem videtur, quos intempestivum sit
in judiciali dissertatione recitare.'' The
Schol. forms a just judgment of Cicero’s
verses: “Nam de consulatu suo scripsit
poetico metro, quae mihi videntur opera
minus digna talis viri nomine.”

ad tempus] Graevius observes that ‘ad
tempus’ means the same as ‘temporis
caussa.’ He refers to the De Am. c. 15
for an example: “coluntur tamen simula-
tione ad tempus.''

31. Cispio] M. Cispius tr. pl. in the
year 13.c. 57 had exerted himself in behalf
of Cicero’s restoration (Pro Sestio, c. 35;
Quum Senatui, c. 8). Cispius was after-
wards prosecuted for Ambitus, and con-
victed in spite of Cicero’s eloquence and
tears.

esse invidia] “This might be the in-
vidious meaning of the words ⁴ Quousque,'
&c.:” how long wiu you continue to make
such a defence as this? How long will
you ask for the acquittal of men because
they are your friends ? But Laterensis did
not mean this. He meant to say, ⁶ How
long will you continue this kind of de-
fence, when you see that it does no good
to your clients?'—‘ condonatus! see Pro
Caelio, c. 32, and the note.
