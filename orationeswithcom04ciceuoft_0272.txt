250 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

vel iniquos vel meos vel etiam defensorum meorum, eodemque ad-
jungas quos natura putes asperos atque omnibus iniquos? deinde
effundas repente, ut ante consessum meorum judicum videam quam
potuerim qui essent futuri suspicari, apud eosque me ne quinque
quidem rejectis, quod in proximo reo de consilii sententia consti-

tutum est, cogas caussam de fortunis omnibus dicere?

N 011 enim,

513111 Plancius ita vixit ut offenderet sciens neminem, aut tu ita

errasti ut cos ederes imprudens, ut nos invito te tamen ad judices*

non ad carnifices veniremus, idcirco ista editio per se non acerba
est. XVII. An vero nuper clarissimi cives nomen editicii judicis

has inclosed these words in [ ]. He believes
them to be spurium, and gives his reasons
at great length in the Prolegomena. I
doubt if all is right in the sentence, and
there are some solid objections against it3
but a discussion of them would take up
more 111311 Wunder’s three quarto pages, if
his objections were stated and the possible
answers were given. I leave the words as
they are, with the remark, that if they were
omitted, the sentence would seem to be the
better for the omission.

in prooez'mo reo] “Jam de sodaliciis
eausam dixerat P. Vatinius eodem defen-
dente M. Cicerone; cujus exemplo negat
iniquitate Laterensis esse Plancio permis-
sum quinque saltem judices rejicere, quo
manifesta sit improbitas obstinate conitentis
inimici ut reus innocens opprimatur con-
spiratione magis iniquorum judicum quam
criminis veritate convictus'’ (Schol. Am-
bros.). P. Vatinius is the man whom
Cicero had so foully abused (Introd. to
the oration In Vatin.). Asconius (Ad
Orat. Pro Scauro) says 11131 Cicero defended
Vatinius in the consulship of L. Domitius
Ahenobarbus and Appius Claudius Pulcher
(B.c. 54³. This was the year in which 116
defended Scaurus and Plancius. He sent
to Gallia to his brother Quintus, who asked
for them, the speeches for Scaurus and
Plancius. Nothing is said of the speech
Pro Vatinio. Perhaps Cicero might not
care if it perished.

11 had been settled in Vatinius' 6356 by
the Judiees (de consilii sententia) that five
Judices could be challenged. But if the
Lex Licinia, under which Plancius was
tried, allowed no challenge‚ that is an an-
swer to what Cicero says here; and it is
plain (6. 17) that the Lex did not.

We cannot reconcile all these things. If
a challenge was allowed in Vatinius’ case,
when 116 was tried under 1116 Lex Licinia,
we cannot tell why it was not allowed in
Plancius' 6356. He says that the jury, or a

jury (consilium), decided in Vatinius’ case,
which I do not understand: a jury deciding
whether or not the Lex should be observed.

Non enim . . . non acerba est] Wunder
compares a passage in the Pro Sulla, 6. 33:
’ί Vos rejectione interposita nihil suspicanti-
bus nobis repentini in nos judices conse-
distis, ab accusatoribus delecti ad spem
acerbitatis, a fortuna nobis ad praesidium
innocentiae constituti.'’ Cicero, says the
Schol. Ambros., had said so much about
the Judiees that there was some reason to
fear that he might offend them, but Cicero
meets this difficulty by saying, that though
Laterensis wished to have men on the jury
who should be mere executionem, yet Plan-
cius had got real Judices. Though this was
so, it did not make the ‘ editio’ in itself a
less hardship to the defendant.

17. clarissimi cives] The Schol. Am-
bros. has a note here which ends ‘⁴ Et bacin
parte commemorationem videtur facere Tul-
lius ejus temporis quo Ser.’' It is conjec-
tured that he wrote ‘ Servius Sulpicius‚’ and
he may probably allude to what Cicero says
of Sulpicius aud the ‘ editicii judices ' in
the oration Pro Murena, c. 23. Cicero is
alluding to some Lex which was not carried.
It had been proposed that out cf cxxv
J udices of the equestrian class, the accused
might challenge LXXV, and retain, that is,
return unchallenged (referret), L; but the
‘ clarissimi cives ³ stirred heaven and earth,
as we say, to prevent the Lex being carried.
This is all that can be said about this ob-
scure matter.

The proposed Lex was, we may conjec-
ture, de Ambitu. Ferratius explains it
thus 1 1116 prosecutor was to name the
cxxv, and Wunder follows him, but Cicero
says -nothing of the kind. He does not tell
us how 1116 cxxv were chosen, except that
we infer froin the latter part of the sentence
that they were taken in some way from the
Delecti judices or the Album judicum.
But how must we explain ⁴ editicii judicis ? '
