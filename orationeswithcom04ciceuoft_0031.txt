OAP. 3, 4. 9

maestum, muta curia, onmia denique bonarum artium studia silu-
erunt. Sed 1111111 511 factum mea caussa: omnia illa senatusconsulta,
, populi jussa, Italiae totius, cunctarum societatum, collegiorum
omnium decreta de me rei publicae caussa esse facta fateamur.
Quid ergo, homo imperitissime solidae laudis ac verae dignitatis,
praestantius mihi potuit accidere? quid optabilius ad immortali-
tatem gloriae atque in memoriam mei nominis sempiternam quam
omnes hoc cives meos judicare, civitatis salutem cum unius mea
salute esse conjunctam? Quod quidem ego tibi reddo tuum.
Nam ut tu me carum esse dixisti senatui populoque Romano non
tam mea caussa quam rei publicae3 sic ego te, quamquam sis omni
diritate atque immanitate taeterrimus, tamen dico esse odio civitati
non tam tuo qnam rei publicae nomine.

IV. Atque ut aliquando ad te veniam, de me hoc sit extremum.
Quid quisque nostrum de se ipse loquatur, non est sane [non est]
requirendum. Boni viri judicent: id· est maximi momenti et pon-
deris. Duo sunt tempora quibus nostrornm civium spectentur
judicia de nobis; unum honoris, alterum salutis. Honos tali populi

the senatusconsulta and the indications of
the popular good-will towards him on the
occasion of his recall. Klotz defends Cicero
from the charge of arrogance. See the next

· note.

bonarum artium] A commentary on
Cicero would be endicss, if it contained all
that has been said on him. A reader os
sound judgment, who keeps his attention
fixed on his author, may often rightly un-
derstand him without being aware that
there is a difficulty. And so it is herc.
Cicero says that in the sorrow for his ab-
sence, the Forum was mourning. the Senate
was silent, finally all liberal pursuits were
struck dumb. There are ‘artes liberales '
and ‘artes sordidae’ (De Off. i. 42). There
were many ⁸ bonae artes ς’ and those which
he is here speaking ofsccm to be the ‘artes'
of those who were engaged in public life,
and chiefly the ‘ars’ of eloquencc. These
kept silence in the Forum and the Curia
only because they were vexed at the fate
which had befallen such an active combatant
in these places ς as Klotz says.
