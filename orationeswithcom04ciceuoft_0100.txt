78 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO

praesidio balnearum collocatos; ex quibus requiram quonam modo
latuerint aut ubi: alveusne ille an equus Trojanus fuerit, qui tot
invictos viros muliebre bellum gerentes tulerit ac texerit. Illud
vero respondere cogam, cur tot viri ae tales hunc et unum et tam
imbecillum quam videtis, non aut stantem comprehenderint aut
fugientem consecuti sint; qui se numquam profecto, si istum in
locum processerint, explicabunt: quam volent in conviviis faceti,
dicaces, nonnumquam etiam ad vinum diserti sint, alia fori vis est,
alia triclinii; alia subselliorum ratio, alia lectorum: non idem
judicum comissatorumque conspectus: lux denique longe alia est
solis ac lychnorum. Quamobrem excutiemus omnes istorum delicias,
omnes ineptias, si prodierint. Sed me audiant, navent aliam
operam, aliam ineant gratiam, in aliis se rebus ostentent: vigeant
apud istam mulierem venustate, dominentur sumptibus, haereant,
Jaceant, deserviant3 capiti vero innocentis fortunisque parcant.
XXIX. At sunt servi illi de cognatorum sententia nobilissi-
morum et clarissimorum hominum manumissi.—Tandem aliquid
invenimus, quod ista mulier de suorum propinquorum fortissimorum

alveusne] An ‘alveus' is a bath, the
part in which a man lies down in the water.
It is not a ‘ labrum‚' but a place constructed
to hold water for a person to bathe in. The
allusion to the Trojan horse would be under-
stood by every body. Orelli remarks that
there was a play of Livius Andronicus, and
a play os Naevius so named (Cic. Ad Div.
vii. l, and 14) ; and accordingly Orelli
writes ¹ equus' with a capital E for this
reason : ‘⁴ Hoc igitur vocabulo Tullius salsis-
sime significat totam istam rem esse fabulam
fictam atque inanem.” But the horse itself
answers all this purpose.

se explicabunt] If they shall come for-
ward as witnesses (in istum locum), ‘they
will never get clear away‚' or something of
that kind. Cicero uses the expression Verr.
ii. 5, c. 58.

diserti sint, alia] A full stop is placed
after ‘ sint ³ in the editions ; but Bake
changed the punctuation as it is in the
text, and Halm has adopted the improve-
ment.—⁴ conspectus ε’ Ursini says that a
‘vetus liber ' has ‘ consessus' in place of
⁴ conspectus.’

jaceant] Pantagathus proposed to write
‘teneant‚' which, as Ursini thinks, makes the
sense somewhat better. Cicero is speaking
rapidly, and he uses single verbs instead of
explaining himself fully. No single verbs in
English will express ‘ haereant, jaceant,
deserviant‚’ but if the reader will complete

the notion implied in each word, the meaning
will be plain.—‘ excutiemus‚’ Index, Vol. ii.

29. de coqnatorum sententia] ‘Upon
the advice and with the approbation of her
cognati :' a common form of expression.
These slaves were manumitted by Clodia
with the consent of her ‘cognati.' Cicero
sarcastically says “at last we have found
something which the woman may be said to
have done upon the advice and with the
authority of her kinsmen ;’' for they could
not approve of the other acts of her life.
The manumission, says Cicero, proves no-
thing. It was either done to bring Caelius
into suspicion, as ifthe woman acknowledged
by the manumission the great services of her
slaves, or it was done to save them from
being put to the torture, for slaves only
could be tortured3 or they were privy to
many acts of their mistress and so she paid
them with their freedom for their services
(cum caussa praemium). ‘ Caussa ' has here
a technical signification. It is the ground
and foundation of the legal act. Clodia
gave them their liberty 3 she rewarded them
with their liberty ⁴ cum caussa,’ with a good
foundation for it. Here of course he means
it in a bad sense; but he uses the legal form
of expression. The old reading was ‘suble-
vata' Manutius saw that it should be
‘sublatas and Lambinus read ‘sublata,’
which is the reading of T. S. P. E. G. have
‘ sublevata!
