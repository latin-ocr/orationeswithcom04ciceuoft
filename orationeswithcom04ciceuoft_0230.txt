ORAT. IN L. OALPURNIUM PISONEM

Nulli conjicientur in illum ordi-

nem, nulli eximentur: non ambitio ad gratiam, non iniquitas ad

simulationem conjicietur.

‚Iudices judicabunt ii, quos lox ipsa,

non quos hominum libido delegerit. Quod quum ita sit, mihi crede,
neminem invitus invitabis ε res ipsa, et rei publicae tempus aut me
ipsum, quod nolim, aut alium quempiam, aut invitabit aut dehorta—

bitur.

Equidem, ut paullo ante dixi, non eadem supplicia esse in

invitus] C. ⁴ invitum,⁷ suggested by
Hotmann and accepted by Halm. The
change is not necessary. Piso had invited
Cicero to prosecute him3 but he did not
wish to be prosecuted, and the invitation
was only a show. (See c. 33.)

non eadem supplicia esse] See ο. 18, 19.
He says ⁵ I do not consider the same things
to be punishments to men (among men)
which perhaps most do, condemnation,
banishment, death! He thinks there is no
‘poena' in that which may happen to an
innocent man, a resolute man, a wise man,
and a good man and citizen. All this and
what follows is intended to be an excuse
for not prosecuting Piso3 for after all that
he has said against Piso, a man might have
askcd, lf Piso is such a villain, why don't
you bring him to punishment, especially
now that the courts are better constituted
since Pompeius has got a new Lex Judi..
ciaria enacted? Instead of saying that he
dared not prosecute Piso, which every body
who listened to him knew to he true, he
has some silly talk about innocent men
having been convicted, and conviction and
punishment being all that could happen to
Piso, if he should be tried. The innocent
and the guilty being equally liable to he
convicted, what is the use of prosecuting a
villain to conviction ? Such is Cicer02s idle
talk.

This talk though very absurd suggests
something. Many things happen to all
men alike, death, disease, and misfortune.
Death is the universal condition of man,
and therefore in itself no punishment
(poena) unless his whole existence is a
punishment, both birth, and life. But
death which a man suffers by the law in
consequence of liis crime, though it is not
a punishment in itself, is an anticipation
of the universal sentence of death, an
event which men generally would put off
as long as they can. That which is in-
flicted as a punishment, banishment, impri-
sonment, and pain, may fall on the guilty
or the innocent. If it falls on the inno-

cent, says Cicero‚ it is no ¹ poena ;’ by which
he means, if he means any thing exact, that
the consciousness of his innocence makes it
no penalty to him. A good conscience cer-
tainly helps a man in his troubles, for in
addition to the pain which may be unjustly
inflicted on him, he has not the conscious-
ness that he deserves it. Cicero supposes
that the guilty are troubled by conscience3
but this is not always sog at least bad men
suffer from their own reflections in very
different degrees, and some not at all.
Piso being a bad man, as we will suppose,

‘might be tormented by his reflections, or

he might not3 but in either case why
should he not also suffer that which might
befal an innocent man, trial, conviction,
and loss of rank and property? Whether
his reflections troubled him or not, he
would feel his punishment severely, as all
men do who have lived a life of ease and
enjoyment, and are deprived of both.
Piso was the proper man, if Cicero's story
is true, to feel the punishment which a just
judgment might inflict on him. At the end
of this chapter Cicero speaks of Catilina’s
two acquittals, and the acquittal of Clodius,
when he was tried for violating the myste-
ries of the Bona Dea. All he can say is
that those who acquitted them were as bad
as the accused3 and perhaps he may mean
to imply that Piso might be acquitted,
though what he says at the beginning of
the chapter implies that he will be con-
victed. In fact he tries to find some excuse
for letting him alone after all these charges
and all this abuse (c. 41), and he can find
none3 and so he rambles in his talk.

He leaves out of consideration that Piso's
punishment by the sentence of a court
would be a warning to others, and might
prevent crime; for the prevention of crime
is one of the ends which men propose when
they punish, and punishment is supposed
to prevent crime to some extent. Another
end of punishment is to prevent the crimi-
nal from repeating his crime by letting him
feel the consequences of it. But this lesson
