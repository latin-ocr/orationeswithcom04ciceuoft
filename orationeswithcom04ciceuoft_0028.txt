6 ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

in altero inconstantiam tuam quum levitate tum etiam perjurio
implicatam refellisti, quum, quem alienissimum a te esse dixisses,
eum domi tuae fuisse, quem praevaricatorem esse ab initio judicasses,
ei te quos rogasset ad accusandum libros dixeris dedisse. II.
Nimium es vehemens feroxque natura: non putas fas esse verbum
ex ore exire cujusquam, quod non jucundum et honorificum ad
aures tuas accidat. Venisti iratus omnibus; quod ego, simulac te
aspexi, prius quam loqui coepisti, quum ante Gellius, nutricula
seditiosorum omnium, testimonium diceret, sensi atque providi.
Repente enim te, tamquam serpens e latibulis, oculis eminentibus,
inflato collo, tumidis cervicibus, intulisti, ut mihi renovatus ille tuus

the reading of P. is this: ‘⁴ Cicero had not,
in what he had said distinguished two
things, to which things these words can be
severally referred 3 but he had signified that
one ⁴ testimonium’ of Vatinius compre-

hended several parts.'⁷ Hermann also says,

“one thing only precedes, from which Cicero
infers two thingsff' The difference in mean-
ing is not much between the two readings,
hardly any.

the truth: ‘⁴ Vatinium, hominem natum
ad risum et odium, scurram fuisse venustum
ac dicacem memoriae proditum est. ln
pedes suos ipse plurima dicebat et in fauces

concisas. sic inimicorum, quos plures habc-

bat quam morbos, et in primis Ciceronis
urbanitatem effugit.'’ The fellow had
humour and sense, and Cicero shewed his
want of sense as well as his want of decency
in alluding to the personal deformities of a

subornatos] See Pro Q. Roscio, c. 17,
note, Vol. ii.——‘implicatam ι’ the same as
‘ conjunctam,’ as Ernesti says—⁴ refellisti :'
‘ you have proved your own inconsistency.'
Garatoni compares Pro Ligario, c. 5: “ re-
fellere et coarguere nostrum mendacimn.''—
⁴ praevaricatorem :' Pro Cluentio, c. 21,
note. The ‘ libri ' are the speeches of Ses-
tius taken down in shorthand, which were
to be used as evidence against him.

2. aecidat] Pantagathus, ‘accidit ' P.

‘accedat’ G. ‘Accidat’ is, ‘falls on the
ear,’ which ‘'accedat would not express.
It is a good correction. — ‘Gellius:’ see Pro
Sestio c. 52. Abrami refers to Juvenal
vii. 148: “nutricula caussidicorum Africa’ 3
and Gellius is here called ‘nutiiculaff to
mark his effeminacy and lew dness, asy s
Abrami.

inflato collo, «ὃς-ι’] Manutius supposes
that Cicero alludes to the passionate temper
of Vatiniu53 buthe jokes on the swellings
on Vatinius’ neck (Pro Sestio, c. 65). Halin
well observes that we may wonder at Tullius
practising this kind of ‘ urbanitas ’ so often,
if Seneca (De Const. Sap. c. 17) has told

man who had disarmed his enemies by his
own good humour and jokes against him-
self.—‘ te intulisti ε’ ⁴ you presented yourself.’

tuus in to * *] In P. there is a great
‘lacuna’ after ‘toz’ “Sunt enim vacui
unius columnae, quae 36 versibus constare
solent, 23 versus, et praeterea tota pagina
sive duae columnae quas vocant. In G.
jam nullum est defectus signum '' (Halm).

C. Cornelium] C. Cornelius, who was
tr. pl. in B. c. 67, brought on himself the
hostility of the senate by the Leges which
he proposed. One of his most important
Leges was this, that only the Populus should
have the power of releasing any person
from the obligation of a Lex. The tr. pl. P.
Servilius Globulus, who was gained over by
the other side, used his veto and resisted
the reading of the Lex by the Pmeco, upon
which Cornelius read it himself (codicem
legisse dicebatur). A great disturbance was
raised against the consul C. Piso, who was
opposed to Cornelius, and Cornelius dis-
missed the meeting. However Cornelius
was charged with exciting a disturbance
and not yielding to the Intercessio of his
