ascribz'] A ‘supplementum‚' as it was
called, was sometimes sent to an old colony,
and the new ⁴ coloni ' were ⁴ ascripti ² to the
old settlers (Livy, 31, c. 49). So long as
the Colonia existed, and could maintain
itself‚ no new Colonia could be settled
within the limits which had been assigned
to the original Colonia with the proper
religious ceremonia] (auspicato).

ut vexillum] This is to be connected
with ‘insolentia elatus . . . deduxisti! This
was a milit-ary Colonia, as the Roman Co-
loniae were from the time of C. Marius,
being principally formed for the purpose of
providing old soldiers with land. C. Cae-
sar’s Campana Lex gave land both to sol-
diers and to poor citizens who had three
children or more. Under Augustus began
the regular system of military colonies. The
⁴ vexillum ' was the military flag under which
the ⁴ coloni ² were led (deducti). Cicero (De
Leg. Agrar. ii. c. 32) says, ‘⁴ vexillum Cam-
panae coloniae.'’ The ‘ vexillum ' is an ordi-
nary type on the coins of the Roman mili-
tary Coloniae. The ⁴ aratrum ’ marked out
the site of the new town. Antonius came
so near to the borders of Capua that he
almost touched its ⁴ territorium! The ⁴ ter-
ritorium ’ is the whole land included within
the limits of a Colonia: “Territorium est
universitas agrorum intra fines cujusque
civitatis'⁷ (Pomponius, Dig. 50. 16.239, 58).
Pomponius adds : ⁴⁴ quod ab eo dictum
quidam aiunt, quod magistratus ejus loci
intra eos fines ten-endi, id est summovendi
jus habent;’' an explanation which is no
better than Varro's (v. 21) 2 ‘⁴ colonis locus
communis, qui prope oppidum relinquitur,

territorium, quod maxime teritur.'' ‘Ter-
ritorium ³ is a word like ⁴ tectorium,’ ⁴ oli-
torius‚’ and contains the clement ⁴ terra.'

Casinatem] Varro’s estate, ⁴ fundus,⁷ at
Casinum, now San Germano, was on the
Via Latina, seven miles from Aquinum.
Cicero says ⁴ Casinas‚’ Abrami remarks, be-
cause Varro had also a villa at Tusculum.
This Varro is the learned M. Terentius
Varro, who once commanded two legions
for Pompeius in Spain (Rc. 49); but he
submitted to Caesar. His reputation was
that of a writer and a learned man, the
most learned of the Romans. He speaks of
his Casinas in his work De Re Rustica, iii.
c. 5, where he had an ⁴ ornithon,’ or place
for singing birds and other kinds. It was
under the Mons Casinus, Monte Casino,
that Varro’s Casinas was situated.

L. Rubrii] In place of this he wrote
originally the name of Scipio: “Libenter
ea corrigam quae a te animadversa sunt,
‘eodem jure quo Rubriana' potius quam
⁴ quo Scipionis ' ’' (Ad Att. xvi. 11).

si ab hasta] ⁴ if you took possession by
virtue of a sale, let the sale be good‚' let it
be valid. The ⁴ tabulae ' are the ⁴ tabulae
auctionariae! But he plays on the word
when he says ⁴⁴ the ‘tabulae ’ by which you
became a debtm, not. those by which you
released yourself.'’ The first are the ⁴ tabu-
lae ’ by which he became a (lebtor for what
he had bought of Pompeius' goods; and
the second are the forged papers of Caesar,
which Antonius had used for fraudulent
purposes. Manutius takes ‘quibus debu-
isti' to mean generally all ‘tabulae' by
which Antonius was bound.
