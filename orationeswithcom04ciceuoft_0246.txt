224 PRO GN. PLANCIO.

but we do not know what was the duration of the exsilium. By the Lex
Tullia it was ten years,

It appeais (Pro Plancio, c. 17) that the Quaesitor or judge who pre-
sided at this trial was named C Alfius, and he was praetor m this year
(Bc 54). The commentators assume that the Lex Licinia gave the
prosecutor the choice of the Quaesitor, an inference which they make from
this oration (c. 27) 3 but if any one will read that passage carefully, he
ought to conclude that the Quaesitor was not named either by the pro-
secutor or the defendant. At the close of the oration Cicero addresses
the Quaesitor by the name of O. Flavi, which has caused great difficulty
to the commentators', and Garatoni has tried to remove it by altering
‘ Flavi ' to ⁴ Flave,’ and making the man's full name G. Flavus Alfius.
(See the note.)

Drumann (Cicero, Geschichte Roms‚ Tullii, ξ 67) says that
Plancius was acquitted3 and he is followed by others. But there is
nothing certain on this point. He ·must have been tried immediately
after his election, and, as it has been remarked, he ought to have been
tried before he entered on his office. The question is not material3 and
there is no very great improbability in the assumption that he had
entered on his office, for he was elected in B.o. 54 to discharge the office
of curule aedile during the remainder of that year. He ought to have
been elected the year before, and tried when he was ‘ aedilis designatus,'
is there was any ground for trying him; but every thing was in con-
fusion in Rome at this time. If Plancius was acquitted, of course he
discharged the duties of curule aedile in the latter part of B.C·. 54; but
there is no evidence in the Roman writers to show that Plancius ever
was curule aedile, except the fact of his election, and we learn from
Cicero's letters (Ad Fam. iv. 14, 15) that in Β.ο. 46 he was living in
Corcyra. Drumann assumes that he was living there under Caesar's
· dictatorship, because he was of the party of Cn. Pompeius; but this, as
usual with Drumann, is mere assertion. Plancius may have been living
out of Italy in consequence of his conviction, or for other reasons,
There is indeed a coin of Cn. Plancius which commemorates his curule
aedileship3 but this proves nothing as to his enjoyment of the curule
office, for it may have been struck immediately after his election. Dru-
mann’s remarks on the case of Plancius are very inexact, and his errors
have been repeated in the article on Cn. Plancius in the Dictionary of
History and Biography. There are some remarks on the trial of Cn.
Plancius in an article on Sinith's Latin-English Dictionary, Westminster
Review, No. xix„ July, 1856.

This oration is difficult in respect of the matter, and sometimes the
