INTRODUCTION. 313

P. Clodius consists in a great degree of the quarrels of P. Clodius and
Milo. In Rc. 57 Milo gave notice that he should prosecute Clodius for
having driven away the workmen who were working at Cicero’s house,
for throwing stones and firebrands against Q. Cicero’s house, and for
attacking Milo’s house. The prosecution however was never commenced,
owing to the activity of Clodius’ friends in the senate. Clodius repaid
Milo in the beginning of Rc. 56 by giving notice that he should prose-
cute him De vi, and for the very acts which Milo alleged that he had
done in self defence. Milo was also charged with keeping armed 111611
111 his service. The accuser and the accused appeared in court accom-
panied by armed men, and a fight took place, in which Clodius’ men
were beaten. This stopped further proceedings.

In B.c. 52 Milo was again charged under the Lex Pompeia De vi3
and this time for the murder of his old enemy. The trial differed from
the usual form of procedure in the witnesses being examined first.
After the examination of the witnesses, the prosecutor, App. Claudius,
spoke, and his two subscriptores, M. Antonius and P. Valerius Nepos.
Cicero spokc in defence of Milo, who was convicted and went into exile.

The passage of Asconius in which 116 speaks of the result of the trial is
printed at the cnd of the oration.
