nebit, nunc certe pertinet esse te talem ut tuas laudes obscuratura
nulla umquam sit oblivio. X. Diversae voluntates civium fuerunt
distractaeque sententiae3 non enim consiliis solum et studiis, sed
armis etiam et castris dissidebamus. Erat autem obscuritas quae·
dam, erat certamen inter clarissimos duces: multi dubitabant
quid optimum esset, multi quid sibi expediret, multi quid deceret,
nonnulli etiam quid liceret. Perfuncta res publica est hoc misero
fatalique bello: vicit is qui non fortuna inflammaret odium suum,
sed bonitate leni1·et; nec qui 01111195 quibus iratus esset eosdem
[etiam] exsilio aut morte dignos judicaret. Arma ab aliis posit-a,
ab aliis erepta sunt. Ingratus est injustusque civis, qui armorum
periculo liberatus animum tamen retinet armatum, ut etiam ,1119
melior sit qui in acie cecidit, qui in caussa animam profudit ; quae
enim pertinacia quibusdam, eadem aliis constantia videri potest.
Sed' jam 01111115 fracta dissensio est armis, exstincta aequitate
victoris: restat ut omnes unum velint, qui modo habent aliquid
non solum sapientiae, sed etiam sanitatis. Nisi te, C. Caesar,
salvo et in ist-a sententia qua quum antea, tum hodie vel maxime
usus es, manente salvi esse non possumus. Quare omnes 19, ⁴qui
haec salva esse volumus, et¹ hortamur et obsecramus nt vitae tuae

Christian nations the effect of a professed who says that Cato said there was great

. belief in a future life is very weak in many
peoplc, as we 599 by daily experience.
With others the effect of a firm belief is
very strong, as the effect of any firm con-
viction must be. The effect of a doubt
about the soul’s immortality, or even a
denial of it, is not the same in all men.
The effect depends on temperament, educa-
tion‚ and the mode of life. With the re-
flecting man the effect is different from
what it is with men engaged in active life.
Caesar, it 15 supposed, had no belief in a
future state (In Cat. iv. 9. 4). If 119 had
not, he might still care during his life
about the opinion which posterity would
form of him (nunc certe pertinet, &c.).

10. Erat autem] F. M. ‘Erat enim’
G. E„ Baiter. The ‘obscuritas' is the dif-
ficulty of knowing what to do. because
there were two great chiefs opposed to 0119
another. Abrami quotes Luean i. 126:

¹¹ Quis justius induit arina
Scire nefas3 magno se jndice quisquetuctur.
Victrix caussa dcis placuit, scd victu Catoni.”

(See Pro Ligario, c. 6.)
Abrami refers to Plutarch (Cato, c. 53),

perplexity and uncertainty in matters apper-
taining to the gods. Pompeius, who ‘⁴ had
always been invincible while hc was doing
what was not honest or just, now when he
wished to save his country and fight in
defence of liberty, was deserted by his good
fortune.” WVhen Pompeius, after his defeat
at Pharsalia, went to Mitylene, he had
some talk with Cratippus, in which he
“found fault with and expressed some
doubts about P1·ovidenee.'' The chapter
is worth reading. (Plut. Pomp. c. 75.)

Pevjswzcta] The State has passed through
this war, and it is now ended.

vicit isqui inflammaret] This form of
the subjunctive requires a carcsnl handling.
The predicate is ‘vicia’ The expression
may bc an abbreviation of the form ‘is qni
vicit non ejusmodi est qui . . . inflmninnret.'
but it is said more emphatieally in 1119,
form ⁴ vicit is,’ διο-,ε ‘the conqueror is not
a man to let his 111111911 bc inllnineil hy
51199955, but to mollify it by his natnrnl
goodness of dispositi‹m.'-—‘ nee qni :¹ G. Ε .

‘haec' is every thing, nll that wc posscss-
It is a connnon nsc of ‘ hace!
