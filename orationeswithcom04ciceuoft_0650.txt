628 ORAT. PIIILII'PIGARUM LIBER DECIMUS.

etiam quibus confidebat alienissimos Transpadanos; Italia omnis
infesta cst; exterae nationes a prima ora Graeciae usque ad
Aegyptum optimorum et fortissimorum civium imperiis et prac-
sidiis tenentur. Erat ei spes una in C. Antonio, qui duorum
fratrum aetatibus medius interjectus vitiis cum utroque cer-
tabat. Is tamquam extruderetur a senatu in Macedoniam, et
non contra prohiberetur proficisci, ita cucurrit. Quae tem-
pestas, dii immortales! quae flamma, quae vastitas, quae pestis
Graeciae [fuisset], nisi incredibilis ac divina virtus furentis ho-
minis conatum atque audaciam compressisset? Quae celeritas
illa Bruti, quae cura, quae virtus! Etsi ne C. quidem Antonii
celeritas contemnenda est, quem nisi in via caducae hereditates
retardassent, volasse eum, non iter fecisse diceres. Alios ad nego-
tium publicum ire quum cupimus, vix solemus extrudere: hunc
retinentes extrusimus. At quid ei cum Apollonia, quid cum Dyr-
rhachio, quid cum Illyrico, quid cum P. Vatinii imperatoris exer-
citu? Succedebat, ut ipse dicebat, Hortensio. Certi fines Mace-
doniae, certa conditio, certus, si modo erat ullus, exercitus: cum
Illyrico vero et cum Vatinii legionibus quid erat Antonio? At ne
Bruto quidem: id enim fortasse quispiam improbus dixerit. Omnes
legiones, omnes copiae, quae ubique sunt, rei publicae sunt: neque
enim hae legiones, quae M. Antonium reliquerunt, Antonii potius
quam rei publicae fuisse dicentur. Omne enim et exercitus et impe-
rii jus amittit is qui eo imperio et exercitu rem publicam oppugnat.

has ‘nec‚' which Faernus explains as
meaning ‘ne C.'—‘ caducae hereditates?
‘ caducum' is properly that which is left
by testament to a person who is capable of
taking it, but does not take it (Ulpian,
Frag. xvii). The law provided for such
cases, as we may suppose, in Cicero’s time.
The Lex Papia Poppaea on this matter
belonged to a later time (A.D. 9), and
gave the ‘ caducum,’ if there was no prior
claimant, to the ‘aerarium 3⁷ and in the
time of the emperors the Fiscus claimed it.
We cannot be certain what Cicero exactly
means. Antonius did not march so quick
because he was picking up money on the
way, and among other things such succes-
sions as he found without any one to take
them. But it requires time to change a
succession into money, and how many
would Antonius find on his road? Cicero
is speaking vaguely.

vix* . . . extrudere] ⁴ Generally we can

scarcely drive others off on public business:
we have driven off this man by trying to
keep him.’

Hortensio] The governor of Macedonia,
the son of the orator. As to the limits of
this province, see Index, ‘Macedonia’—
‘cum Illyricoz' Caesar had Illyricum for
his province with both the Galliae (3.0.
59). P. Vatinius, who was consul at the
end of B.c. 47, was sent in 13.c. 46 by
Caesar to Illyricum. He was there in
13.c. 45, and wrote a letter to Cicero from
Narona. They were now good friends,
notwithstanding Cicero’s past abusa (In
Vatinium). He was also there in B.c. 44.
It seems that the river Drilo and the town
of Lissus were the southern boundaries of
Illyricum. The northern boundary stretched
to the Dalmatae, who were not in the
province, for in B.c. 45 Vatinius was at
war with the Dalmatae (Ad Div. v. 10), as
Vatinius’ letter to Cicero shows, and Cicero’s
answer (Ad Div. ν. ll).—⁴ neque enim hae
