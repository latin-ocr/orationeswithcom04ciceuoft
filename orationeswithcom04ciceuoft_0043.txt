OAP. 10, 11. 21

quem civem! quem virum! qui duo nefarios patriae proditores,
domesticos hostes, legibus exterminarat, hominem ad conservandam
rem publicam natum, in idem Vettii indicium atque in eundem
hunc numerum congregasti. Quid ego de me querar? qui etiam
grat-ias tibi agere debeo, quod me ex fortissimorum civium numero
sejungendum non putaris. XI. Sed qui fuit tuus ille tantus furor,
ut, quum jam Vettius ad arbitrium tuum perorasset et civitatis
lumina notasset descendissetque de rostris, eum repente revocares,
colloquerere, populo Romano vidente, deinde interrogares, ecquos-
nam alios posset nominare? inculcarisne ut G. Pisonem generum
meum nominaret, qui in summa copia optimorum adolescentium
pari continentia, virtute, pietate reliquit neminem? itemque M.
Laterensem, hominem dies atque noctes de laude et (le re publica
cogitantem? promulgarisne, impurissime et perditissime hostis,
quaestionem de tot amplissimis et talibus viris, indicium Vettio,

domicilio ex mag-na copia deligerent‚'’ out of
all Gallia, which offered abundance of choice.

Macedonia as quaestor, it being the practice
for proconsuls or propraetore to leave the

quaestor with authority (cum imperio) to
look atter the province, if their successor
did not arrive when they left; as Cicero did
in Cilicia, Ad Att. vi. 6 (Hotmann).
Paullus was in Macedonia when he was
charged with being privy to the design upon
Pompeius, and this fact rendered the story
of Vettius less probable (Ad Att. ii. 24).

duo . . proditores] This Paullus had com-
menced a prosecution of Catilina, as Sallust
(Catil. c. 31) says: “et ipse lege Plautia
interrogatus ab L. Paullo ;” in Cicero's con-
sulship. Shortly after Catilina left Rome
and took up arms. Accordingly Cicero
says ‘legibus exterminarat.’ The Scholiast
says that C. Cethegus was the other. But
Goveanus suspects that it was Autronius
who did leave Rome (Pro Sulla, Vol. iit).

de me querar] Cicero was not named
by Vettius, but he was pointed at. Cicero
(Ad Att. ii. 24) says: “ me non nominavit,
sed dixit consularem disertum, vicinum
consulis, sibi dixisse, Ahalam Servilium
aliquem aut Brutum opus esse reperiri.”
See Pro Sestio, c. 63, and the note.

ll. revocares] Cicero, Ad Att. ii. 24:
‘⁴ Addidit ad extremum, quum jam dimissa
contione revocatus a Vatinio fuisset, se
audisse a Curione his dc rebus conscium
esse Pisonem generum meum et M. Late-
rensem.” See Pro Sestio, c. 21. on Piso.
The young man showed his ‘ pietas.’ his tilial
duty to Cicero in his exile.—‘ qui in summa
copia optimorum ι’ ⁴ who, though there
was abundance of excellent young men,’
διο. So Caesar (Β. G. i. 30) writes “locum

—‘ nerninem reliquitz' ‘he left no one be-
hind him.’ He was dead3 and it seems that
he died during Cicero’s exile.

Laterensem] Laterensis refused to be a
candidate for the tribunate, that he might
not have to take the oath required by
Caesar's Lex Agraria for the division of
the lands in Campania (Ad Att. ii. 18) :
“ Habet etiam Campana lex exsecrationem
in contione (aliter, coitione) candidatorum,
si mentionem fecerint, quo aliter ager pos-
sideatur atque ut ex legibus Juliis. Non
dubitant jurare ceteri. Laterensis existima-
tur laute fecisse, quod tribunatum pl. petere
destitit, ne juraret.”

indicium Vectio] Vatinius promulgated,
made public, a Lex to the effect that a
Quaestio should be held, that is, an extraor-
dinary commission should be named, for
trying those whom Vettius denounced <sec
the end of c. 9), a Quaesitor and a Consilium
of Judices. He also proposed that Vettius
should be admitted to give evidence (Vettio
indicium esset) on the trial, and have the
impunity and other advantages οἳ being
so admitted; as Madvig well explains it.
And he proposed a reward (praemia) too.
In the Divin. c. ll (Vol. i. and tln· note)
there is the expression ¹ indicium dari ς’ and
in the oration Pro Roscio Amerino. v. 37
(vol. ii.), “qui indicii partem a‹·ct·perit‚'' the
meaning of which is plainly. 'receiving his
part or share sor giving the infin-:nunnus
Cicero (Ad An. ii. 2⁴) speaks uf this wholl-
affair ot' the conspiracy being ridicula-d in
the Senate3 aud it may hnvc been treated
