104 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

poterant in provincias nostras redundare, ita ab eodem esse partim
recisas, partim repressas, ut Asia quae imperium antea nostrum
terminabat nunc tribus novis provinciis ipsa cingatur. Possum de
omni regione, de omni hostium genere dicere. Nulla gens est quae
non aut ita sublata sit ut vix exstet, aut ita domita ut quiescat,
aut ita pacata ut victoria nostra imperioque laetetur. XIII.
Bellum Gallicum, patres conscripti, C. Caesare imperatore gestum
est, antea tantummodo repulsum. Semper illas nationes nostri
imperatores refutandas potius bello quam lacessendas putaverunt..
Ipse ille C. Marius, cujus divina atque eximia virtus magnis populi
Romani luctibus funeribusque subvenit, influentes in Italiam Gallo-
rum maximas copias repressit, non ipse ad eorum urbes sedesque
penetravit. Modo ille meorum laborum, periculorum, consiliorum
socius, C. Pomptinus, fortissimus vir, ortum repente bellum Allo-
brogum atque hac scelerata conjuratione excitatum praeliis fregit,
eosque domuit qui lacessierant3 et ea victoria contentus re publica

metu liberata quievit. C. Caesaris longe aliam video fuisse rationem. ⁴

redundare . . . recisas] First a meta-
phor from water over-flowing, then one from

of the Garonne, having forits north-western
boundary the range of the Cevennes. Cicero

the knife applied to cutting and lopping,
and thirdly one from the act of pushing
back.

Asia] See the remarks on the Province
Asia, Vol. ii. p. 285. The commentators
say that the three new provinces are Bithy-
nia, Pontus, and Syria. The epitome of
Livy (102) mentions the reduction of Pontus
to the form of a province by Pompeius.
Bithynia belonged to the Romans in 13.c.
74, and Pompeius after the death of Mithri-
dates added to it the west part of Pontus.
The rest of Mithridates' kingdom was given
to different kings. Bithynia from nc. 63
was generally called Bithynia et Pontus, and
was under a Propraetor. It was some time
simply called Bithynia. (Becker, Hand-
buch, iii. l, p. 146.) The other province
is it seems Cilicia, which Pompeius organised
about 13.c. 64, for though the name of Cilicia
had been applied to a province some time
before, this early province of Cilicia compre-
hended very little of Cilicia Proper. Ser-
vilius Isauricus 13.c. 75 formed the province
of Cilicia, but it consisted nearly altogether
of parts of Lycia, Pamphylia, and Isauria.
In 13.c. 64 Pompeius established the pro-
vince of Syria.

13. repulsum] The Romans had con-
quered the Galli of North Italy, and they
had also established a provincia north of the
Alps which extended from the west end of
the Lake of Geneva to Toulouse in the plain

means by ‘illas nationes ' the Helvetii and
others who were beyond the limits of the
province.

refutandas] The same as ‘ repellendas.’
⁴ Refutare' is a form of fund (fud). For
the Romans said ‘ fundere hostem.’

C. Marius] Part of the invaders whom
Marius drove back and destroyed came out
of Gallia, but they were not Galli. They
were Cimbri and Teutones who had ravaged
Gallia terribly (Caesar, Β. G. ii. 43 vii. 77),
and there is no proof that any of the Gallie
peoples joined them in their march into the
Provincia, unless some of the Helvetii did.
Cicero's statement is that Marius repelled
the great armies of the Galli, but that he did
not penetrate to their cities and country. The
fact is entirely perverted, one of the many
instances of the worthlessness of Cicero’s
history. Hotmann knew that these men
were Cimbri and Teutoni, but he adds, it is
probable that they were conducted by Galli
to the detiles that lead into Italy. Let it
be so. That will not make Cicero a bit
nearer the truth.

C'. Pomptinus] He was praetor B.c. 63,
and served Cicero in the affair of Catilina's
conspiracy (Vol. iii.); and afterwards de-
feated the Allobroges when he was the
governor of the Provincia Gallia (In Cat. iii.
) Ο. Caesaris] He says that Caesar's de-
sign was to subdue the Galli, but whether
