82 onAT. PRO M. CAELio

enim tantum erat quantum homines loquebantur, verum ex eo quid-

· quid erat emersit totumque se ejecit atque extulit, tantumque abest

ab illius familiaritatis infamia ut ejusdem nunc ab sese inimicitias
odiumque propulset. Atque ut iste interpositus sermo deliciarum
desidiaeque moreretur— fecit me mehercule invito et multum repug-
nante, sed tamen fecit—nomen amici mei de ambitu detulit3 quem
absolutum insequitur, revocat; nemini nostrum obtemperat; est
violent-ior quam vellem. Sed ego non loquor de sapientia, quae non
cadit in hanc aetatem: de impetu animi loquor, de cupiditate
vincendi, de ardore mentis ad gloriam; quae studia in his jam
aetatibus nostris contractiora esse debent, in adolescentia vero
tamquam in herbis significant quae virtutis maturitas et quantae
fruges industriae sint futurae. Etenim semper magno ingenio
adolescentes refrenandi potius a gloria quam incitandi fuerunt:
amputanda plura sunt illi aetati, si quidem efflorescit ingenii laud-
ibus, quam inserenda. Quare si cui nimium effervisse videtur hujus
vel in suscipiendis, vel in gerendis inimicitiis [vis] ferocitas, si quem
etiam minimorum horum aliquid offendit, si purpurae genus, si
amicorum catervae, si splendor, si nitor, jam ista deferverint, jam
aetas omnia, jam dies mitigarit.

iste interpositus sermo] ‘ In order that
this talk about his amours aud indolence
might die away,’ in which translation ‘ in-

in riper age. He continues the same meta-
phor. Youth wants pruning, if it shows
the fiower of talem, rather than ingrafting

terpositus’ is omitted. It is one of the
numerous examples of difficulty in transla-
ting from Latin. Cicero says ⁴ talk inter-
posed ' (interpositus), but that which is in-
terposed is interposed between two things
at least, either different things, or the same
kind of things. The metaphor is not com-
pleted in Latin. It is left to the hearer or
reader to complete it. The ‘sermo' or
common talk about Caelius was like some
obstacle in the course that he had to run:
it was an interruption of continuity. We
must determine the character of the meta-
phor before we can get at the meaning, and
when we have got the meaning, we must
express it as well as our language will
allow 3 sor we cannot equal the Latin
brevity. We may say then ‘in order that
this talk which was a hindrance in the way
of his political career might die away.'
There is an example of ‘interpositum ' in
the In Pisonem, c. 2.

nomen amici] Cicero's friend Atratinus.

llis jam aetatibus nostris] He is ad—
dressing the judices: ‘in men who have
reached the age that we have! Luxuriance
in youth, as he says, gives promise of fruit

(inserenda).

effervisse]
4 inimicitiis :’ Halm writes 4 inimicitiis suis!
The MSS. have 4 inimicitiis νίς] After
4 ferocitas ’ S. has ‘ pertinacia,' and in some
editions the passage standsthus—⁴ inimicitiis,
vis, ferocitas, pertinacia‚' which is an ab·
surd collection of words, and would spoil
Cicero's argument. With respect to 4 ini-
micitiis vis ’ Madvig quoted by Halm says:
44 Asyndeton bimembre hoc quidem loco
ferri non potest. Suspicor paene vis ortum
esse ex ultimis literis vocabuli inimicitiis .·’'
and this is a very probable conjecture.

si purpurae yenus] We may inser some-
thing about Caelius’ habits from the orator’s
admissions. His dress was costly (genus
purpurae), of a better, finer dye than that of
other equites. See Pro Sestio, c. 8. If any
of these things, says Cicero, offends any per-
son, those things will soon cool down. Cae—
lius will mend of these youthful faults.

jam dies] ‘jam ista dies ’ E. G. S. P. has
the same with a space between ‘ista’ and
‘ dies.' Orelli has ‘jam res,jam dies.’ Halm
following Ravius writes ‘jam usus, jam dies
mitigarit!

4 efferbuisse ' E. Halm.—
