CAP. 1, 2. 7

contra auspicia tulerit3 num Aeliam, num Fufiam legem neglexerit;
num consuli vim attulerit; num armatis hominibus templum
tenuerit3 num intercessorem vi dejecerit; num religiones polluerit,
aerarium exhauserit, rem publicam compilarit. Tua sunt, tua sunt
haec omnia. Cornelio ejusmodi nihil objectum est. Codicem
legisse dicebatur. Defendebat testibus collegis suis non se recitandi
caussa legisse, sed recognoscendi. Constabat tamen Cornelium
concilium illo die dimisisse, intercessioni paruisse. Tu vero, cui
Cornelii defensio displicet, quam caussam ad patronos tuos aut quod
os afferes? quibus jam praescribis quanto illis probro futurum sit,
si te defenderint, quum tu mihi Cornelii defensionem in maledictis
objiciendam putaris. Ac tamen hoc, Vatini, memento, paullo
post istam defensionem meam, quam tu bonis viris displicuisse dicis,
me, quum universi populi Romani summa voluntate, tum optimi
cujusque singulari studio, magnificentissime post hominum memo-
riam consulem factum, omniaque ea me pudenter vivendo conse-
cutum esse, quae tu impudenter vaticinando sperare te saepe

dixisti.

colleague. Soon after he went out of office,
he was prosecuted for Majestas by C. and P.
Cominius on the ground of not having
yielded to the Intercessio of his colleague.
But the Praetor, L. Cassius Longinus. not
appearing on the tribunal, and the triends of
Cornelius putting the prosecutors to flight,
Cassius stopped the proceedings‚ and the
prosecutors did not appear again on the
next day. In the next year, uc. 65, the
prosecution of Cornelius was taken up by
P. Cominius again, and Cicero defended
Cornelius on four several days. Cornelius
was acquizted (Rein, Das criminali-ecla der
Romen Asconius, In Cornel. p. 56).

contra auspicia] which Vatinius had
done (c. 9), and all the rest that Cicero
mentions—‘Aeliam ς’ see Index, Vol. iii.—
⁴ codicem:’ which contained the terms of
his Lex. It was the usual practice to pub-
lish (promulgare) the terms of a Lex by
setting it up in the Forum or other places,
where it could be copied. (De Lege
Agraria, ii. 5, Vol. ii.) The Lex was
sometimes read by a Scriba (Appiam, B. C. i.
12), as in this case: ‘¹ Is (P. Servilius tr.
pL), ubi legis ferendae dies venit, et praeeo
subjiciente scriba verba legis recitare populo
coepit, et scribam subjicere et praeconem
pronuntiare passus non est. Tum Cornelius
ipse codicem recitavit” (Becker, Rom. Alt.
i. p. 26, note 41).

desmidebat] P. G. have ‘defendebatur,'

but as the best MSS. have ‘non se reci-
tandi,¹ and not ⁴ non recitamli,' Madvig
made the correction ‘ defendebat) He
atiirms that· defendor fecisse’ is not Latin,
but as Halm remarks, there is no reason
why the Romans could not say ‘defendor
fecisse,’ which means, ⁴ it is maintained that
I did 3' and Cicero uses this form, as he
shows (De Inv. ii. 32) ε “ Necessitudo autem
infertur, quum vi quadam reus id quod
fecerit fecisse defenditur.'¹

sed recognoscendi] For the purpose
merely of seeing if it was correctly written,
says Manutius; and he compares Pro Balbo,
c. 5 ι “ nos Cn. Pompeii decretum. judicium
de consilii sententia pronuntiatum recog-
noscemus.’'-‘ praescribis : ' ⁴ you show
them how disgraceful it will be to them.’

paullo post] The defence was in 13.c.
65, and Cicero was elected consul in n. c.
6⁴.——‘ bonis viris :' the Optimates whom, as
Vatinius said, Cicero offended by desemling
Cornelius—⁶ post hominum ε’ see what
Cicero says of his electiori, De Lege Agraria,
ii. 1.—‘vaticinando:‘ his declaration that
he should be consul sometime, and so he
was at last, for a few days n. c. 47: ¹⁴ In
consulatu Vatinii, quem paucis diebus gessit,
notabilis Ciceronis urbanitas circumfere-
batur: Magnum ostentum, inquit, :inno
vatinii factum est, quod illo consule nec
bruma, nec ver, nec aestas, nec innuamus
suit” (Macrob. Sat. De jocis M. Tullii
