6-8. 391

minum tantae latebrae sint et tanti recessus, augeamus sane sus-

picionem tuam, simul enim augebimus diligentiam.

Nam quis est

omnium tam ignarus rerum, tam rudis in re publica, tam nihil um-
quam nec de sua nec de communi salute cogit-ans, qui non intel-
ligat tua salute contineri suam, et ex unius tua vita pendere

omnium ἓ

Equidem de te dies noctesque, ut debeo, cogitans,

casus dumtaxat humanos et incertos eventus valetudinis et naturae
communis fragilitatem extimesco, doleoque, quum res publica im-

mortalis esse debeat, eam in unius mortalis anima consistere.

Si

vero ad humanos casus incertosque motus valetudinis sceleris etiam
accedat insidiarumque consensio, quem deum, si cupiat, opitulari

posse rei publicae credamus?

VIII. Omnia sunt excitanda tibi,

G. Caesar, uni, quae jacere sentis belli ipsius impetu, quod necesse

fuit, perculsa atque prostrata3

constituenda judicia, revocanda

fides, comprimendae libidines, propaganda suboles, omnia quae

dilapsa jam defluxerunt severis legibus vincienda sunt.

Non fuit

recusandum in tanto civili bello, tauto animorum ardore et ar-
morum, quin quassata res publica, quicumque belli eventus fuisset,

tantae latebrae] Nobody had a better
right to say this than Cicero. He expresses
his fears for Caesar’s life, he the man who
a little later saw Caesar murdered, exulted
over his death, and wished that some others
had been murdered at the same time. He
says (Ad Att. xiv. 14), “laetitiam quam
oculis cepi justo interitu tyranni.'’ He
was however not privy to the conspiracy,
for the conspirators could not trust him.
Wolf has a remark ou the words ‘ Equi-
dem de te‚’ &c. He says that this is the
way in which a flatterer speaks to a tyrant,
not the consular to the dictator. Dru-
mann answers this. He reminds us that
Cicero thought of writing a poem on Cae-
sar’s victories in Britain and Gallia3 and
in· the oration De Prov. Cons. 110 lauded
him extravagantly‚ as he had before be-
praised Pompeius (De Imp. Cn. Pompeii).
110 flattered Caesar again in the speech
Pro Ligari0; and he did many other mean
things, which Drumanu collects3 und some
more might be added to the list.-lt is not
the flattery of this chapter which is a reason
for doubting if Cicero wrote it as we have
xit. lle was capable of saying all this and
more; and if he had said twice as much,
that would not be a sufficient reason for
disputing 1115 title to the authorship of this
oration. It is the way 111 which it is said
that is the true reason for doubting if 110
wrote ‘sed tamen quum in aniinis’ to 1110

end of the chapter.

8. judicia] ‘The courts must be re-
established, credit (fides) restored. violence
checked, and population encouraged’ ⁸ Su-
boles' is the genuine orthography. 'l'he
word means ‘that which grows up, or
growth.' Cacsar Augustus, the dictator's
successor, endeavoured to encourage niar-
riage by the enactment of the Lex Papia
Poppaea. The best encouragement to mar-
riage is the maintenance of peace, and the
establishment of 5000111)γ for life and pro-
perty. Augustus did more for repairing 1110
105505 in the civil wars by restoring security,
than by legislative enactments for the en-
couragement of marriage.

Klotz observes, that population could
only be increased by legislation‚ by rewards
for productive marriages, and that as Caesar
was now the man from whom alone laws
and political regulations could proceed, it
was quite right to say ⁴ tibi uni . . . pro·
pagancia suboles.’ He adds, ‘¹ How per-
versely and tastelessly wolf here thought
only of the physica! 111-0010111100 of children.
which duty the declamator, as Wolf takes
it, 111051- be understood to be imposing 011
Caesar by using these words.’' 1 suppose
Wolf was joking‚ as he often did. 110
0001(1 not of course mistake the meaning,
but he thought that the expression was
strange3 and so it is.—-‘curanda:’ F. M„
⁴ sananda’ G. E. Baiter.
