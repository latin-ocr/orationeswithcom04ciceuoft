406 ORAT. PRO Q. LIGARIO

Quum M. Cicero apud te defendit alium in ea voluntate non fuisse
in qua seipsum confitetur fuisse, nec tuas tacitas cogitationes exti-
mescit, nec quid tibi de alio audienti de se ipso occurrat reformidat.
III. Vide quam non reformidem, vide quanta lux liberalitatis et
sapientiae tuae mihi apud te dicenti oboriatur. Quantum potero
voce contendam ut hoc populus Romanus exaudiat: Suscepto bello,
Caesar, gesto etiam ex parte magna, nulla vi coactus, judicio ac
voluntate ad ea arma profect-us sum quae erant sumpta contra te. ·
Apud quem igitur hoc dico? Nempe apud eum qui, quum hoc
sciret, tamen me antequam vidit rei publicae reddidit ς qui ad me
ex Aegypto litteras misit ut essem idem qui fuissem3 qui, quum
ipse imperator in toto imperio populi Romani unus esset, esse me
alterum passus est3 a qu0‚ hoc ipso O. Pansa mihi nuntium per-
ferente, concessos fasces laureatos tenui quoad tenendos putavi3
qui mihi tum denique se salutem putavit reddere, si eam nullis spo-

librario irrepsisse'’ (Gruter).—‘ monumen-
tisque:' Halm remarks that 111 1110 first
part of the imperial period mention is
made of real ‘arae clementiae.' I don’t
think that Cicero here alludes to this.
‘ Literae monumentaque’ is ‘letters and
memorials’ of any kind.

defendit] ‘when he maintains.'

3. Quantum potero . . . parte mayna]
Quoted by Quintilian xi. 3. 166; and also
‘¹ Suscepto bello . . . contra te,’' ix. 2. 28,
which Quintilian quotes as an example of
the figure Licentia, called by the Greeks
παῤῥησὶα. Ηο says “Quid enim minus
figuratum quam vera libertas? Sed fre-
quenter sub hac facie latet adulatio. Nam
Cicero quum dicit pro Ligario, ‘Suscepto
bello . . . sumpta contra te‚' non solum ad
utilitatem Ligarii respicit, sed magis lau-
dare victoris clementiam non potest.'’—
—‘ exaudiat :’ see luder, Vol. iii.

qesto etiam] Cn. Pompeius was driven
from Italy before Cicero left it to join him
111 Epirus3 and Sicily was 3150 vacated by
the Pompeian party. A long letter of
Cicero to Atticus (x. 8), written after Pom-
peius had left Italy, and while Caesar was
on his way to Spain to oppose Pompeius’
legati, shows Cicero’s unsteady resolution
at this critical time. This letter contains a
copy of a letter from Antonius to Cicero,
in which Antonius begs him not to leave
Italy, and a copy of a letter from Caesar to
Cicero, written by Caesar on his road to
Spain, and dated the l7th of April, ‘ex
itinere! Caesar entreats Cicero to stay in
Italy and to take no part in the contest,

See

‘proclinata jam re‚' now when things
were in favour of Caesar. It is a very
sensible and moderate letter, and has all
the air of sincere friendship. Yet the
foolish man went after all on the 7th of
June Β.0. 49 10 join those whom he feared
and despised (Ad Div. xiv. 7).

ρι’ Aeyypto] Cicero was at Brundisium
in B.c. 47 anxiously waiting for a letter
from Caesar, which 110 got at last about
the middle of August: “Redditae mihi
tandem sunt a Caesare literae satis liberales '’
(Ad Div. xiv. 24. 23).

imperator . . . unus] In 13.c. 46 Caesar
was Dictator (Plut. Caesar, c. 51); and he
received the title of Imperator as a Prae-
nomen (Sueton. Caesar, c. 67). 111 1110
republican period, as Tacitus says (Ann.
iii. 74), there were often several Impe-
ratores, but Caesar's title of Imperator
prefixed to his name was a new thing
(Dion 43, c. 44).

fasces laureatos] Cicero brought his
‘fasces laureati' with him from Cilicia
B.c. 50, expecting to have a triumph for
his petty victor-ies over the mountaineers
of the Amanus. He reached the gates of
Rome early in January (n.c. 49), but he
did not enter the city, because he would
have thereby lost the chance of showing
himself in his triumphal car. He carried
about with him his withered bays till he
was tired of them (Ad Div. ii. 16). Caesar
allowed him to keep them after he saw
Cicero at Brundisium in September B.C. 47.
In October Cicero was at Rome, and got
rid of his rubbish there, as we may sup-
pose.
