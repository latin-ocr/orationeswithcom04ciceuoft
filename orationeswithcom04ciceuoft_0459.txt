nobilis, sed optimus paterfamilias et diligentissimus agricola et
pecuarius haberetur. Qui igitur adolescens nondum tanta gloria
praeditus nihil umquam nisi severissime et gravissime fecerit, is ea
existimatione eaque aetate saltavit? X. Imitari, Castor, potius
avi mores disciplinamque debebas quam optimo et clarissimo viro
fugitivi ore male dicere, Quod si saltatorem avum habuisses
neque eum virum unde pudoris pudicitiaeque exempla peterentur,
tamen hoc maledictum minime in illam aetatem conveniret. Quibus
ille studiis ab ineunte aetate se imbuerat, non saltandi, sed bene
ut armis, optime ut equis uteretur, ea tamen illum cuncta jam
exacta aetate defecerant. Itaque Deiotarum quum plures in equum
sustulissent, quod haerere in eo senex posset, admirari solebamus.
Hic vero adolescens, qui meus in Cilicia miles, in Graecia commilito
fuit, quum in illo nostro exercitu equitaret cum suis delectis
equitibus, quos una cum eo ad Pompeium pater miserat, quos con-
cursus facere solebat, quam se jactare, quam ostentare, quam
nemini in illa caussa studio et cupiditate concedere 2 Quum vero
exercitu amisso, ego, qui pacis semper auctor fui, post Pharsali—
cum [autem] praelium suasor fuissem armorum non deponendorum,
sed abjiciendorum, hunc ad meam auctoritatem non potui adducere,
quod et ipse ardebat studio illius belli et patri satis faciendum
esse arbitrabatur. Felix ista domus quae non impunitatem solum
adepta sit, sed accusandi etiam licentiam: calamitosus Deiotarus,

Cassius Dionysius Uticensis' work on agri-
culture, which itself was a Greek translation
of the work of Mago the Carthaginian, with
some additions from Greek writers. Halm
says, Diophanes reduced Mago's work to six
books from the original twenty-eight, but 1
think that he has mistaken Varro's mean-
ing. The Galatiam was a good husband
(‘ paterfamilias:' Pro P. Quintio, c. 3, and
the note), a most careful farmer, and a
flock-mastcr (pecuarius). He would have
a good markz·t in the large towns of Asia,
and a good price for his wool. Amyntas,
who was set up as a king by M. Antonius
(13.c. 39). was the greatest floek-master in
Asia. He had above three hundred flocks
on the table lands of Lycaonia.

10. iu illam aetatem] lf he had been a
dancer, the ealumny of Castor could not
apply to so olda man as Deiotarus. His
dancing days were over, but not his riding
days. He could hold on, when he was
mounted. Abrami compares Horace, Carm.

in Cilicia miles] See the Introduction.
—‘in Graeciaz' Cicero was not in Graecia
during the Civil VVar. He was at Dyrra-
chium with Cn. Pompeius, and there he
may have seen Castor and his cavalry.
Cicero did not go into Thessaly with Cn.
PompeiuS‚ and it is difficult to understand
how Cicero could advise Castor aster the
battle of Pharsalia, as the words seem to
mean, though Ι would not undertake to say
what he does exactly mean. Soldanus thinks
that ⁴ exercitu amisso' is spurious. llahn
places ‘post Pharsalicum praelium ‘ in [ ].
There is no difficulty about the words in
this sentence. The question is about the
fact, and there is no great difficulty iu as-
suming that Cicero did not tell the truth.
What he. said before Caesar wc do not
know; but as far as the evidence ot* the
MSS. shows, and we have no other. this is
what Cicero wrote. sse who was so eare-
less about facts, would not be very cnm-ful
about them when he was sending copies ot'
his speech to Dolabella, and perhaps to
old Deiotarus.
