INTRoDUeTION. 117

could to effect a reconciliation between Crassus and Pompeius (Cic. Ad
Att. ii. 3, where he says “ Cornelius 3 hunc dico Balbum Caesaris fami-
liarem ”).

In his consulship Cacsar gave Balbus the place of ‘ praefectus fabrum '
(Pro Balbo, o. 28), an office which would bring no trouble with it during
the year of Caesar's consulship, for Caesar was in Rome. It does not
appear whether Balbus went with Caesar to his province in Bc. 58. ln
the year when this speech was delivered, Balbus was not with Caesar.
Caesar never mentions Balbus in his Commentaries, but that does not
prove any thing. A letter of Cicero (Ad Q. Fr. iii. 1, 12) shows that
Balbus was with Caesar in Gallia in Ro. 54. Cicero’s letters to Tre-
batius (Ad Div. vii. 6, 7) also show that Balbus was with Caesar in
that year. But Balbus was in Rome in the beginning of ne. 541 (Cic.
Ad Fam. vii. 5), and he was probably there the greatest part of the
time after Caesar went into Gallia (13.0. 58), and for the purpose of
looking after the interests of his friend. The author of the eighth book
of the Gallie War addresses it to Balbus„

Balbus’ prosperity and his connexion with Caesar made him enemies
at Rome, who induced some man from Gades to prosecute Balbus for
acting as a Roman citizen without having a right. The fact of Balbus
having received the civitas from Pompeius and this having been con-
firmed by the Lex Gellia was not disputed; but other reasons were
urged against his citizenship. Gades was a Foederata Civitas3 and the
prosecutor maintained that a citizen of Gades could not become a Roman
citizen without the consent of the Gaditani, which consent had never
been given. This matter is examined by Cicero, and the prosecutor's
legal doctrines are refuted. Pompeius and Crassus spoke for Balbus,
and Cicero also spoke for him, though it seems that he did not like
Balbus much. Cicero spokc last (Pro Balbo, c. 1).

There is nothing in this speech which proves in what year it was de-
livered. Some critics have fixed itin the year 13.c. 55. But ΒΕ. 55
was the second consulship of Crassus and Ponipcius; and Cicero often
names Crassus and Pompeius in this speech, and yet he does not speak of
them as consuls. The speech cannot have been delivered earlier than nc.
56, because the fifteen days’ supplicatio for Caesar's victorics of nc. 57
are mentioned, as they are in the oration De Provin. Consului-ibus (Pro
-Balbo, c. 27 ; De Prov. Cons. c. 11), and it is also said that Caesar had
not been superseded (“ lege Sempronia succedendum non censuit‚‘' c.
27); which proves that the speech was delivered after the speech De
Provinciis Consularibus. The conclusion then is, that it was delivered
in 13.c. 56. Cicero and Balbus’ other patrous were successful. Balbus
retained his citizenship, and made his fortune by following Caesiu‘s.
In 13‚c. 40 he was consul.
