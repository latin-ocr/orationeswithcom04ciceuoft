aut proficit aliquid, aut, si non proficit, non obest civitati. Vo-
luimus quaedam, contendimus, experti sumus: obtenta non sunt.
Dolorem alii, nos luctum maeroremque suscepimus. Cur ea quae
mutare non possumus convellere malumus quam tueri? C. Cae-
sarem senatus et genere supplicationum amplissimo ornavit et nu-
mero dierum novo. Idem in angustiis aerarii victorem exercitum
stipendio affecit, imperatori decem legatos decrevit, lege Sempronia
succedendum non censuit, Harum ego sententiarum et princeps et
auctor fui, neque me dissensioni meae prist-inae putavi potius assen-
tiri quam praesentibus rei publicae temporibus et concordiae con—
venire. Non idem aliis videtur. Sunt fort-asse in sent-entia fir—
miores. Reprehendo neminem, sed assentior non omnibus: neque
esse inconstantis puto, sententiam tamquam aliquod navigium atque
cursum ex rei publicae tempestate moderari. Sed si qui sunt,
quibus infinitum sit odium in quos semel susceptum sit, quos video
esse nonnullos, cum ducibus ipsis, non cum comitatu assectatori—
busque confligant. Illam enim fortasse pertinaciam nonnulli, vir-
tutem alii putabunt: hanc vero iniquitatem omnes cum aliqua cru-
delitate conjunctam. Sed si certorum hominum mentes nulla
ratione, judices, placare possumus, vestros quidem animos certe

supplicationum] Au this matter is ex-
plained in the oration De Provinciis Con-
sularibus; and also the matter of the ten
legati. and the Lex Sempronia. Here we
are told that Caesar's victorious army re·
ceived pay ; but we do not know what this
stipendium was, unless it was a sum of
money allowed Caesar for the prosecution
of the war. In this year 13.c. 56 he had
conducted a campaign against the Veneti,
for which he had to build a fleet, and we
cannot conceive that he could have had
sufficient means, if he had not received sup-
plies from Rome. His preparations for
this naval campaign are briefly told (B. G.
iii. 9), but we can easily see that his large
fleet eost him an immense sum. He built
ships on the Loire, and manned thern
from the Provincia. Besides his own ships,
he had ships from the Santones and
Pictones (B. G. iii. 11). Caesar destroyed
the Venetian navy: he annihilated the
maritime power of the Armoric states, the
earliest peoplc on record who had a fleet in
the waters of the Atlantic Ocean.

inconstantis] Inconsistency is the com-
mon charge against nien who ineddle with
matters political. Cicero had once been
Caesar's enemy, or Caesar had been his.
Cicero had not approved os Caesar’s mea-
sures in his consulship, but Caesar was now

in the career of victory, had tamed Rome's
greatest enemy, and was popular. Cicero
accepted the public judgment, and con-
formed his own conduct to it. He denies
that there is any inconsistency in this, and
compares the course which a man must
follow in affairs political to the management
and direction ofa ship's course, which must
depend on the wind. The apology is in-
genious enough; and there is some truth
in it. He says the same thing about the
ship more at length in the letter to Lentu-
lus (Ad Fam. i. u, §21); and something
more. This letter to Lentulus was written
in 13.c. 54, when Cicero's brother Quintus
was a legatus of Caesar in Gallia 3 and it ex-
presses Cicero’s complete submission to his
great protector: ‘⁴ Apertius autem haec ago
ac saepius, quod et Quintus frater meus
legatus est Caesaris, et nullum meum mini-
mum dictum, non modo factum, pro Caesare
intercessit, quod ille non ita illustri gratia
exceperit, ut ego eum mihi devinctum pu-
tarem. Itaque ejus omni et gratia, qnae
summa est, et opibus, (luas intelligis csse
maximas, sic fruor ut meis. Nec inihi aliter
potuisse videor hominum perditurum de nie
consilia frangere, nisi cum praesidiis iis. quae
semper habui, nunc etiam potentium hene-
volentiam conjunxissem.’'—¹ susceptum sit:'
