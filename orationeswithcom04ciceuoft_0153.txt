J ure enim nostro neque mutare civitatem quisquam invitus potest,
neque si velit mutare non potest, modo adsciscatur ab ea civitate
cujus esse se civitatis velit: ut, si Gaditani sciverint nominatim de
aliquo cive Romano ut sit is civis Gaditanus, magna potestas sit
nostro civi mutandae civitatis, nec foedere impediatur quo minus ex
cive Romano civis Gaditanus possit esse. Duarum civitatum civis
noster esse jure civili nemo potest3 non esse hujus civitatis civis
quise alii civitati dicarit potest. Neque solum dicatione, quod in
calamitate clarissimis viris Q. Maximo, C. Laenati, Q. Philippo
Nuceriae, C. Catoni Tarracone, Q. Caepioni, P. Rutilio Smyrnae
vidimus accidisse, ut earum civitatum fierent civesz--hanc ante
amittere non potuissent quam hoc solum civitatis mutatione ver-
tissent-sed etiam postliminio potest civitatis fieri mutatio. Neque

man law a man could not be a citizen of
Rome and of another state too, it is 3 cer-
tain conclusion that such a person either did
not become the citizen of another state by
being received into it, or that he ceased to
be a Roman citizen. Now it cannot be
maintained that such a person did not be-
come a citizen of the state into which 116
was admitted, for the Romans had no doc-
trine of allegiance like ours. Theret'ore he
ceased to be a Roman citizen. The doctrine
is sound and consistent3 and Osenbrueggen
has proved nothing against it by mixing up
the case in the Pro Caecina and the case
which we have heret The Roman principle
about a man changing his citizenship is sim-
ple. There was not and hardly could be a
formal mode of renouncing the Roman 6111-
zenship, before aman had got another place
to go to. In tbe civilized states os Europe in
all ages a man must liavea country of which
he is a citizen, or in which he is a subject.
The evidence to the Romans that a citizen
had left their state, would 116 1116 fact of his
having been received into another state.
The rule that a citizen or subject cannot re-
nounce the obedience which· he owes to 1115
state, and this is the law of England, is
founded on a principle which can no longer
be strictly maintained, the principle of alle-
giance to the crown. But if an Englishman
formally renounces his allegiance by bc-
coming a citizen of another state, as he
often does, it is just that if he should be
considered to have rid himself of the duty
of his allegiance, he should also lose all the
rights which his allegiance secures him.

se . . . dicarit] Here we have an in-
stance of a use of ⁴ dicare,’ which shows the

meaning of the word. If he ‘ shall have at—

calamitate :' after being condemned for some
offence, or leaving Rome to avoid sentence.
It is uncertain what Q. Maximus Cicero
speaks of. One Laenas named P. Popilius
Laenas was driven from Rome by a Lev of
C. Gracchus, and afterwards restored (Vol.
iii. Index). Abrami conjectures that Philip-
pus is Q. Marcius Philippus, who was con-
sul with Cn. Servilius Caepio (ac. 1039).
and had the province Macedonia (Liv. Ep.
4⁴). These men became citizens of Nuceria
(Nocera), the Campanian Nuceria, as we
may assume. There was a Nuceria in L'm-
bria, and two others of the name. C. Cato’s
condemnation is alluded to in the Verrinc
orations (ii. 4, 6. 10). lle retired to Tarraco
(Tarragona) in Hispania Citerior. Q. Caepio
is the man who plundered Tolosa (Toulouse)
and the Gallia Provincia ac. 1011, and was
defeated by the Cimbri. Valerius (vi. 9)
says he died 111 prison. P. Rutilius Rufus
was wrongfully convicted by the Roman
Equites, who were at. that time the Judiccs.
