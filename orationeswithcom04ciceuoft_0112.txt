90 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS GONSULARIBUS

per se et quietam, tenui pracsidio atque exigua manu etiam sinc
imperio per legatos nomine ipso populi Romani tuebamur3 quae
nunc consulari imperio atquc exercitu ita vexata est, vix ut se possit
diuturna pace recreare: quum interea,—quis vestrum hoc non
audivit, quis ignorat Achaeos ingentem pecuniam pendere L. Pisoni
quotannis, vectigal ac portorium Dyrrhachinorum totum in hujus
unius quaestum esse conversum, urbem Byzantiorum vobis atque
huic imperio fidelissimam hostilem in modum esse vexatam? quo
ille, posteaquam nihil exprimere ab egentibus, nihil ulla vi a miseris ἱ
extorquere potuit, cohortes in hiberna misit, iis praeposuit, quos
putavit fore diligentissimos satellites scelerum, ministros cupiditatum
suarum. Omitto jurisdictionem in libera civitate contra leges
senatusque consulta; caedes relinquo, libidines praetereo, quarum
acerbissimum exstat indicium et- ad insignem memoriam turpitudinis
et paene ad justum odium imperii nostri, quod constat nobilissimas
virgines se in puteos abjecisse et morte voluntaria necessariam
turpitudinem depulisse. N ec haec idcirco omitto, quod non gravis-
sima sint, sed quia nunc sine teste dieo. IV. Ipsam vero urbem

praetor, for instance to a quaestor, who then of Pindus and Oeta to the Maliac Bay ; on
had his province ‘pro praetore‚' as Sallust the east the river Nestus. Macedonia, as

expresses it (Cat. c. 19).
quae nunc consulare* imperio] ‘which

now though it is held by a man with con-
sular imperium and an army ς’ a use of the
Latin ablative, which is very common. Here
the ablative is opposed to ⁴ tenui praesidio,’
&c.—‘ vix ut ι’ ‘ ut vix ' G² ; but the other
is the more emphatic and the true order, as
in Caesar, B. G. i. 6, “ unum (iter) . . .
angustum et difficile, vix qua singuli carri
ducerentur ;'' B. G. i. 25, ‘· multi ut diu,⁷⁷
δια, and Β. G. iii. 4, “vix ut his rebus,'’
διο. So other words are put in a like order
for the purpose of emphasis, as Cicero (Ad
Att. ii. 8), ‘¹ spes ut nulla sit ;” Pro Caelio,
c. 31, ‘⁶ plus ut.” By observing the position
of words in a Latin sentence we learn the
reason of their being placed as they are.
Achaeos] This passage shows that at
this time Achaea was included in the Pro-
vincia Macedonia, or at least was adminis-
tered by a legatus under the orders of the
proconsul. See Vol. iii., note on Achaia,
and In Pisonem, c. 16. We have no autho-
rity for the limits of the Roman Macedonia
except Ptolemaeus (iii. 13, ξ 12). On the
north was Dalmatia and Moesia; Dalmatia
being separated from Macedonia by the river
Drilo (Drino), and Moesia by the range of
Scordus: on the west the Hadriatic was the
bcundary3 on the south Epirus and the range

we see from this passage, also comprehended
part of the Illyrian coast. for the towns of
Apollonia and Dyrrhachium were under
Piso's administration. Cicero tells us that
the governor applied to his own use the
vectigal and portorium of Dyrrhachium.
Compare Pro Sestio, c. 43: ‘⁴ cogere pecu-
nias maximas a Dyrrhachinis, spoliare Thes-
salos, certam Achaeis in singulos annos
pecuniam imperavisse.’'

jurisdictionem] or ‘juris dictionem!
Byzantium being a ‘libera civitas,’ or a state
whose freedom was secured by a Lex or a
Senatus consultum, was freed from the duty
of receiving a Roman garrison, and had the
administration of justice (jurisdictio) ac-
cording to its own laws, which in Greek is
named αὐτονομία. Hence such a state is
called on medals ἐλευθέρα καὶ αὐτονόμος.
Polybius (xviii. 29) expresses their condition
thus: ἡ σύγκλητος ὴ Ῥωμαίων καὶ Τίτος
Κοΐντιος-ἁφιᾶσιν ἐλευθέρους, ἀφρουρή-
τους, άφορολογήτους, νόμοις χρωμένους
τοῖς πατρίοις Κορινθίους, διο.

necessariam] Which they could not
avoid except by death (Abrami). Lambinus
says that ¹ nefariam ’ is wanting in two
MSS. ; but there seems to be no authority
for the reading ‘ nefariam ' in place of ¹ nc-
cessariam)
