OAP. 6, 7.

interfuit inter Catilinam et eum, cui tu senatus auctoritatem, salu-
tem civitatis, totam rem publicam provinciae praemio vendidisti?
Quae enim L. Catilinam conantem consul prohibui, ea P. Clodium

facientem consules adjuverunt.

Voluit ille senatum interficere, vos

sustulistis; leges incendere, vos ab1·ogastis; vi terrere patriam, vos

adjuvistis.

Quid est vobis consulibus gestum sine armis?

7. vi terrere] ‘interimere,⁷ the Juntine
and Halm. The MSS. have ⁴ interire,' ex-
cept G„ which has ‘vi terrere) If ‘ inter-
imere' is accepted, there is no difficulty in
⁴ adjuvistis,’ which Schiitz proposed to alter
to ‘afflixistis'

Madvig says that Piso and Gabinius
united with Clodius are compared with
Catilina. He also says, that as we have
‘adjuvistisJ we require an active verb in
the place where ‘interire' stands3 that ‘ in-
terimere patriam ' is not a usual metaphor,
and after ‘ interficere senatuin,' which is to
'oe taken literally, it is absurd. Next, ‘ vos
adjuvistis' is very bad. WVhom did they
help? Clodius, we must suppose. But
first of all, it is not the crimes of Clodius
only, but those of Piso and Gabinius which
are mentioned. Again, Clodius cannot be
meant3 for‘ ille ' is Catilina. ‘⁶ ‘ Ille (Cati-
lina) voluit patriam interire3 vos adjuvistis‚'
si recta esset oratio, patriam adjuvisse in-
telligerentur3 ut nunc caetera sunt, neces-
sario Catilinam adjuvisse putandi sunt, quod
ineptissimum est. Omnino non adjuvisse
aliquem illi dici debent, sed aliquid ipsi
secisse, quod tantumdem sceleris contineat
et ejusdem generis sit atque id quod Cati-
lina fecerit.'' He further asks what is the
meaning of the vehement interrogatio,
· Quid est . . . sine armis?' or how is it
connected with what precedes and follows ?
for after this Cicero continues the compari-
son‚ with this change only, that he mentions
all the conspirators (illa conjuratorum ma-
nus) instead of Catilina. Accordingly Madvig
writes ‘ vi terrere patriam: quid est vobis
consulibus gestum sine armis ?’ making
Cicero use an interrogat-ion 111 the second
member instead of an affirmation, like ¹ vos
abrogastis) Somebody thinking that 1110
form of the sentence should bo consistent
all through, put in “ vos adjuvistis! (Mad-
vig, cited by llalni, Addenda et Corri-
genda.)

The argument against ⁴ interimere ¹ may
be allowed; antl‘ vi terrere’ may be perhaps

Ac ne illi quidem, si habuissent
vestri similem consulem, de urbis incendio cogitassent.

N on enim

safely taken instead of ⁴ interire! The rest
15 ingenious3 but it does not convince me.
Cicero asks what was the difference between
Catilina and Clodius. There was none.
“The consuls helped Clodius when he was
doing the things which 1 prevented Cati-
lina from doing.'⁷ But Cicero could not say
that Clodius did what Cicero prevented Ca-
tilina from doing. Such an assertion would
he ridiculous, and he could only make it
oratorie, and even then he must say some-
thing in explanation. Let us suppose that
‘ ille’ is Clqdius. It is true that he did not
intend to massacre the senate, as far as 1
know; nor did Piso and Gabinius massacre
it, or destroy it, or whatever ‘ sustulistis'
may mean. ⁴ Leges incendere' applies to
Clodius3 and ‘vos abrogastis’ to Piso and
Gabinius. (Pro Sestio, c. 153 In Pison. c. 5,
‘ bustum legum.’) ¹ Vi terrere patriam ’
15 not applicable to Catilina, if we look to
the technical sense of ‘vis 3' a difficulty
which Madvig felt, for he says, “vis et arma
eodem genere continentur, eadem suntz'’
sometimeS‚ not always, nor here. Clodius
created terror by acts of ‘ vis,’ and the con-
suls helped him. ⁴ Quid est gestum sinc
armis ?’ is a very proper conclusion after
⁴ vi terrere . . . adjuvistis! Cicero had
said, that if Piso and Gabinius had been
consuls when he was, they would have
aided Catilina with money and provisions.
They did help Clodius (consules adjuverunt).
How did they help him? They did some
things which he wished to do. That is not
exactly hclping; but when by 1115 turbu-
lence he alarmed the Patria, then they did
help him (‘ vos adjuvistis. Quid cst‚' aa).
There is not much weight in the argument
founded on ¹ illa conjuratorum manus.' Cn-
tilina’s band. Cicero says they wished 11)
burn Rome ς ‘you burnt my house.y 'l'l‘n¹
introduction of ‘illa conjuratorum 1111111115 “
may bo viewed 115 evidence that “ illc ' is 11111
Catilina—‘his stantil)us:’ 111- means 1111·
Patres3 he says shortly after, ⁴ me stante ct
manente' (Hotmunn).
