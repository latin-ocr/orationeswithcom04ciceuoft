quem ad modum aiunt, pilam : retinere quod acceperat, testificari,
tabellas obsignare velle, Epicurum disertum dicere3 est tamen:
dicit, ut opinor, se nullum bonum intelligere posse demptis corporis
voluptatibus. Quid multa? Graecus. ‘facilis et valde venustus
nimis pugnax contra senatorem populi Romani esse noluit.
XXIX. Est autem hic, de quo loquor, non philosophia solum,
sed etiam litteris, quod fere ceteros Epicureos negligere dicunt,
perpolitus. Poema porro facit ita festivum, ita concinnum, ita
elegans, nihil ut fieri possit argutius. In quo reprehendat eum
licet si qui volet, modo leviter, non ut impurum, non ut- improbum,
non ut audacem, sed ut Graeculum, ut assentatorem, ut poetam.
Devenit autem seu potius incidit in istum, eodem deceptus supercilio
Graecus atque advena quo tot sapientes et tanta civitas. Revoeare
se non poterat familiaritate implicatus, et· simul inconstantiae
famam verebatur. RogatuS, invitatus, coactus, ita multa ad istum
de isto quoque scripsit, ut omnes libidines, omnia stupra, omnia

tabellas obsiqnare] He acted like a man
who wished to have evidence recorded: 118
appealed to the witnesses who had heard
what the philosopher said, he would have it
taken down and put under scal: he said
that Epicurus spoke plain enough, and his
words wanted ι110 confirmation: and he is
(est tamen). Halm writes ⁶ Epicurum
desertum dicere; etenim dicit’ following
Madvig. “ Piso Epicurum desertum clama-
bat ab iis. qui dogma de corporis voluptate
tenerent.” (Halm.) Perhaps the text is not
right ; 31111 ‘ etenim ’ 111 111300 of ⁴ est tamen ’
is clearer; for Cicero means Epicurus when
he says ‘⁶ dicit, ut opinor '’ &c., ‘ ut opinor '
not expressing any doubt.

The Greek philosophers were always dis-
puting about plcasure. It was a war of
words, for pleasure 1135 many meanings.
Gellius (ix. 5) says: ‘⁴ De voluptate vete-
res philosophi diversas sententias dixerunt.
Epicurus voluptatem summum bonum
esse ponit3 eam tamen ita (10111111 ι
σαρκὸς εὐσταθὲς κατάστημαε” which ex-
presses about the same thing that Metro-
dorus the Epicurean said: “Metrodorus
quidem perfecte eum putat beatum cui
corpus bene constitutum sit et exploratum
itu semper fore. Quis autem cst istc cni
id exploratum esse possit ?’' There are nu-
merous passages about Epicurus iu Cicero,
31111 111 some of them 1118 opinions of Epi-
curus arc clearly stated. as they ought to be,
for Cicero says that Epicurus expresscd
what he meant and speaks plain enough to be
understood (De Fin. i. ὃς 11. 5). But when
we only know a man's doctrines from such

short unconnected notices as Cicero gives
os Epicurus, it is impossible to corneto any
just conclusious. The chief passages about·
Epicurus are contained in the Historia l'hi-
losophiae by Rittcr and Preller. The Latin
word ‘ voluptas ' is the exact equivalent to
the Greek ildovfp (De Fin. ii. 4).

29. de isto quoqne] V. has ‘ quoque.'
The Greek wrote poetry about other things
and about Piso too (isto quoque), all his
pleasures 31111 even his amours with married
women. Cicero knew these poenis‚0r he could
not have said that he would have read them
except for sear that they might not be suit-
ahle 10 1118. place in which 110 was speaking.
He leaves us to infer, I suppose (in quihus
. . . intueri). that he learned the particular-s
of Piso’s life from these poems; but 118
0011111 1101 lcarn from them that Piso's table
was loadcd with tainted meat. Philodemus
must have. betrayed the secrcts of Piso’s
house to l'iso’s greatest enemy.

110 sayS, ⁴¹ In these verses any man who
chooses may look into Piso’s life as into 3
mirr01·.’' But 3 man who looks into a
mirror sees only himself. 111 'l'aerenee the
use of the mirror is proper (Adelph. iii. 3.
v. 61) :

‘⁴ Inspicere tamquam in speculum in vitas

onmium
Jubeo atque ex aliis sumere exemplum

tibi.'’

Look on the lives of others as into n mii-mr,

and you will 580 what you may be your-

self.
