it ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

indignitate labes illius dignitati aspersa videatur. Primum quaero,
num tu senatui caussam tuam permittas, quod facit Caesar? deinde,
quae sit auctoritas ejus, qui se alterius facto, non suo defendat?
deinde, erumpet enim aliquando ex me vera vox et dicam sinc
cunctatione quod sentio, si jam violentior aliqua in re C. Caesar
fuisset, si eum magnitudo contentioniS, studium gloriae, praestans
animus, excellens nobilitas aliquo impulisset, quod in illo viro et tum
ferendum esset et maximis rebus quas postea gessit oblitterandum,
id tu tibi, furcifer, sumes, et Vatinii latronis ac sacrilegi voi<
audietur hoc postulantis, ut idem sibi concedatur quod Caesari?
VII. Sic enim ex te quaero. Tribunus pl. fuisti: sejunge te
a consule: collegas habuisti viros fortes novem. Ex iis tres erant,
quos tu quotidie sciebas servare de caele, quos irridebas, quos
privatos esse dicebas, de quibus duos praetextatos sedentes vides, te
aediliciam praetextam togam quam frustra confeceras vendidisse,
tertium scis ex illo obsesso atque afflicto tribunatu consularem

nobilitas] As Manutius reminds us, 7. tres· erant] The Scholiast supposes
Caesar 111 1115 funeral oration over his aunt them to be Domitius Calvinus, Q.Ancharius,

Julia derived his pedigree from Venus, and C. Fannius. See Pro Sestio, c. 36, on
which is certainly an antient pedigree3 like the ⁴ intercessio ’ of the tribuni. Vatinius

that of the Antonii, who came from Anton,
a son of Hercules, and thus ultimately from
Jupiter (Plutarch Antonius, 6.4). 1131111
has the following remark. “noblemen (viri
nobiles) think they may do many things,
which men os plebeian stoa< are not allowed
to do with impunity, and then they very
readily allow themselves to be hurried
somewhither (aliquo), when they 566 that
their plans are opposed.'' Ι suppose it is
so, as he tells us that it is.

mammis rebus] It was now the third
year of Caesar's Gallic war, and he had done
very great things (maximis rebus). He had
slaughtered the Helvetii, driven Ariovistus
and his Germans into the Rhine, broken the
Belgian confederation in the bloody fight
on the Sambre, and reduced all Gallia to
submission (B. G. ii. 35). Cicero's argument
is ludicrous and very disgraceful to him.
Caesar had done many things in his consul-
ship which Cicero disapproved, and though
Caesar had submitted his Lex Agraria to the
Senate, he afterwards did not trouble him-
self about getting their previous approbation.
κάκ τούτου οὐδ’ ἄλλο τι τῇ γερουσίᾳ ἐν
τῆ ἀρχῇ ττιὺτη ἐπεκοηώ1 nasi, ἀλλ7 ἐς
τὸν δῆμον ἄντικρυς πάιΘ’ ὅσα έβώλετο
ἐσέφερεν (Dion 38, c. 4).

Cicero’s argument is this: [f such a great
gentleman as C. Caesar was hurried on to
some irregulaiities‚ such a dirty fellow as
you must not claim the same licence.

treated his colleagues as if they were private
persons (privatos dicebat), who had no
power ‘servare de 63610.’--ό praetextatos
sedentes ε’ they were praetors, and Vatinius
could 566 them, or Cicero says that he could,
sitting in their dress on the Sella curulis.
The Scholiast in his lemma omits the word
‘aediliciam' and the omission is approved
by Madvig, for these reasons : The words
‘praetexta toga' ought to be referred to
⁴ praetextatos,' and not the word ‘ aedilicia ;’
at least ⁴ aedilicia' ought not to be placed
first: it was not an ‘aedilicia toga‚' for
Vatinius had not been elected aedile; and
the adjective so placed would signify that
the praetexta of all the magistratus was =ot
the same3 which, as he says, is fa:‹·‚e.
Halm, who answers these objections, says
they* are acute. Quite the contrary, I
think. All we have to do is to give some
reason why the Schol. omits the word, and
as Orelli observes, the Schol. often omits
in the lemma that which can be omitted
without any injury to the meaning.
Vatinius had ordered his official dress
before the election was over. One has heard
of such mistakes in our own times; of a
man getting a new card plate rather too
soon. Cicero (Ad Fam. ii. 16) says :
“Togam praetextam texi Oppio puto te
audisse.”
