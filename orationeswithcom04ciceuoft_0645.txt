INTRODUCTION TO THE TENTH PHILIPPIO.

Tflts oration was delivered on the occasion of despatches from M.
Brutus, who was in Macedonia and had been getting troops together
without any authority. Cicero in this oration recommends that the
senate should confirm what M. Brutus had done, as they had confirmed
what D. Brutus and Caesar had done without authority. Appian says
(iii. c. 63) that the senate gave Brutus authority to administer Mace-
donia and Illyris, and to command the forces in each country until pub-
lic affairs should be settled.
