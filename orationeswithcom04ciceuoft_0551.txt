CAP. 45, 46. 529

imperitam delenierat: suos praemiis, adversarios clementiae specie
devinxerat. Quid multa? attulerat jam liberae civitati partim
· metu, partim patientia consuetudinem serviendi. XLVI. Cum illo
ego te dominandi cupiditate conferre possum, ceteris vero rebus
nullo modo comparandus es. Sed ex plurimis malis, quae ab illo
rei publicae sunt inusta, hoc tamen boni est, quod didicit jam popu-
lus Romanus quantum cuique crederet, quibus se committeret, a
quibus caveret. Haec non cogitas, neque intelligis satis esse viris
fortibus didicisse quam sit re pulchrum, beneficio gratum, fama
gloriosum tyrannum occidere? an, quum illum homines non tule-
rint, te ferent? Certatim posthac, mihi crede, ad hoc opus curre-
tur neque occasionis tarditas exspectabitur.

Respice, quaeso, aliquando [rem publicam, M. Antoni ς] quibus
ortus sis, non quibuscum vivas, considera; mecum, uti voles; redi
cum re publica in gratiam. Sed de te tu [ipse] videris: ego de me
ipse profitebor. Defendi rem publicam adolescens, non deseram
senex: contempsi Catilinae gladios, non pertimescam tuos. Quin
etiam corpus libenter obtulerim, si repraesentari morte mea libertas
civitatis potest, ut aliquando dolor populi Romani pariat quod
jamdiu parturit. Etenim si abhinc annos prope viginti hoc ipso in
templo negavi posse mortem immaturam esse consulari, quanto
verius nunc negabo seni ἓ Mihi vero, patres conscripti, jam etiam

wasteful expenditure of ill-gotten money,
but the Dictator did not spend the money
on himself. The splendour of the Roman
spectat-,le was for all the Romans. Even
Augustus, who succeeded to Caesar's power,
did not live like a modern king. The large
sums which he expended were laid out on
embellishing Rome, and not on his own
house or family (Suetonius, Augustus, c. 73,
101). Dion’s reflections on the money-
spending may be his own thoughts; or if
not his own, certainly only those of the
better sort at Rome. The peoplc in the
usual sense of the term would be pleased,
for Caesar was not spending their money.
46. beneficio qratum] ‘ pleasing in the
service’ to the Patria, of course. Assas-
sination is declared to be a noble act, ser-
viceable to a State, and glorious to the
assassins, when they kill a tyrant. Anto-
nius, if lie saw this speech, had warning
enough3 and if he did not see this speech,
we may suppose that he had copies of the
fourth Philippic. It is no wonder that he
took better care of himself than Caesar did.

vot„ lv·

D. has ‘cum re p. redi.'—‘adolescens:'
when he was consul, about twenty years
before. In c. 44 he speaks of ‘ adolescentes,’
who were men of forty or so.—‘reprae-
sentari :’ ⁶ if by my death the liberty of the
State can be immediately secured.’ ‘Re-
praesentare’ means to make a thing pre-
sent, to do it now. Caesar (B. G. i. e. 40) ε
“Itaque se quod in longiorem diem colla-
turus fuisset repraesentaturum et proxima
nocte de quarta vigilia eastra moturum.''
See also Cic. Ad Div. v. 16, 6.

quod jamdiu parturit] That is ‘in-
teritum tuum' (Manutius).—⁴abhinc anuos
prope vigintiz’ see c. l, where he says,
‘⁸ liis annis viginti.'' ⁸ Abhine’ being used
to mni-k thc point of time from which the
rcckoning is made, the accusative is used to
express the ‹lui-atlon.

mortem immaturam] See In Cat. iv.
c.‘2‚und the note.— ⁴ adeptus sum . . . opto.
unum :’ these words are wanting in V. in
the original text, and have been supplied
by another hand (Halm).
