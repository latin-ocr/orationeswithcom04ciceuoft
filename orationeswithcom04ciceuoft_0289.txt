OAP. 27, 28. 267

Quamquam dissimilis est pecuniae debitio et gratiae. Nam qui
pecuniam dissolvit, statim non habet id quod reddidit; qui autem
x debet, aes retinet alienum z gratiam autem et qui refert habet, et
qui habet, in eo ipso quod habet refert. Neque ego nunc Plancio
desinam debere, si hoc solvero3 nec minus ei redderem voluntate
ipsa, si hoc molestiae non accidisset. Quaeris a me, Cassi, quid
pro fratre meo, qui mihi est carissimus, quid pro meis liberis, qui-
bus nihil potest mihi esse jucundius, amplius quam quod pro Plan-
cio facio facere possim; nec vides istorum ipsorum caritate ad
hujus salutem defendendam maxime stimulari me atque excitari.
Nam neque illis hujus salute, a quo meam sciunt esse defensam,
quidquam est optatius, et ego ipse numquam illos aspicio quin,
quum per hunc me iis conservatum esse meminerim, hujus meriti

in me recorder.

Quamquam dissimilis . . . non accidisset]
This passage is quoted by Gellius, i. 4,
where he tells us what Antonius Julianus, a
rhetorician, said of this passage, and his ex-
planation of ‘ debere ' and ⁴ gratiam habore)
I do not sce that Cicero’s play on words
can cause a reader any difficulty 3 nor that
WumIer's explanation helps the matter.
Cicero says that a debtor (qui debet) has
what belongs to another, ‘ aes retinet
alienum,' which may be said in a sense, as
people sometimes say it now, but every
⁴body knows that it is false3 for a man who
has borrowed a hundred pieces from an-
other, and accordingly owes him a hun-
dred pieces, is still only a debtor for a hun-
dred pieces. Those which he has received
as a loan become his own property, as the
Roman lawyers tell us (Gaius, iii. 90), and
as the law of all nations must allow. If a
man returns a favour, he may still be grateful
for it, or he ought to be. He returns in
one sense, but he still has in another. The
Roman language can express this, but we
cannot. Cicero is therefore quite right when

he says : ⁴ However the obligation of a debt ,

and the obligation of a service or favour arc
quite different) The orator laying hold of
Cassius’ word ‘dcbcre,’ treats us with this
comment on it.

VVunder’s explanation may be right
enough, but it is obscured by a cloud
of words. There is really nothing that
wants explanation. 1 deny however his ex-
planation of ‘pecuniam debere) He says
correctly that ‘debere’ is compounded of
‘de' and ‘habere‚' aud hence it appears
that ‘ pecuniam debere ' is properly nothing
else than ‘ habere de altero pecuniam‚’ i. e.
‘ habere pecuniam, quae est alterius! This

Opimium damnatum esse commemoras, serva-

is a false explanation, contrary to all the
principles of law, contrary to the Roman
use of words. XVhen the Romans said that
a man ⁴ aes retinet alienum,' they did not
mean what the words literally expreSS. As
already observed, a man who lends a sum
of money, transfers the ownership of it. If
he did not, he could claim back the very
pieces of money. The change of ownership
is the foundation of this action for his debt
(condictio). Accordingly we have the clear
definition of ‘aes alienum’ (Dig. 50. 16.
213) : “Aes alienum est quod nos aliis
debemus ; aes suum est quod nobis debent :''
the first expresses our debts (passif), the
second our credits (actif); or, as Savigny
explains (System, &c., p. 514, note), ‘aes
alienum . . . debomusss ⁴· that is to say, the
money which has been transferred from the
owncrship of another inan to our own, and
which must go back again into the owner-
ship of the former owner-‚⁰

Baiter has ‘ is retinet alienum,' for which
he cites Τ. Ε. and Gellius. XVundcr says
that the best MSS. of Gellius have *aesff

quam quod] Lambinus saw that this
‘ quod ' was wanted ; and some of tho best
MSS. have it.—‘ Opimium ε’ see Pro Sestio,
c. 67.—⁴ Calidium :' this is 9., the father
of the orator M. Calidius. Quintus was
convicted of Repetundae (Verr. Act. i. c..
13). Q. Metellus is Numidicus. Sco ln-
dex, Vol. iii.

Cassius spoke of two great men, ns he
called them, whose services to the snite
did not save them from couvivtion ; mul he.
blames Ci‹·ero's entreuties ou helluli* of l'lun-
cius, who had not the same personui morit
as Opimius and Calidius, and ought not te
be saved by Cicero's prayers.
