452 INTRODUGTION

We now know enough of Antonius' character to estimate Cicero’s
judgment, who thought the conspirators should have killed him when
they killed Caesar3 aud the events show that Cicero was right. To kill
one consul and leave the other was absurd, when they knew Antonius'
character so well. As Cicero says, they had not well considered their
plan. On the day of the murder (March 15) the assassins took shelter
in the Capitol, being amazed to find that the people did not respond to
their cry for the restoration of liberty and the constitution. Antonius,
who being at the door of the senate-house must have known of Caesar’s
death as soon as it was done, got out of the way and hid himself. In.
the night of the 15th Lepidus brought some troops into the city, and it
would seem to have been an easy matter to storm the Capitol and mas-
sacre all the conspirators, who had only some gladiators of Decimus
Brutus to protect them (Phil. iii. 6. 9, and the note). Antonius had
courage enough and no scruples, but he was cunning too, and he wished
to get his ends in some easier way.

After Caesar's death P. Cornelius Dolabella assumed the consulship,
and thus became the colleague of Antonius. Dolabella was a youth
about twenty—five years of age. Caesar had declax-ed 111 the beginning
of the year (13.0. 44) that Dolabella should hold the consulship for the
remainder of the year, after he had left Rome for his Parthian expedition.
The Comitia were formally held for the election of Dolabella, but Anto-
nius, who was jealous of him, attempted to invalidate the election by an
Obnuntiatio, in his quality of augur. It seems however that the elec-
tion was maintained, and Antonius recognized Dolabella as his colleague
in the sitting of the 17th of March in the temple of Tellus (Phil. i.
6. 13; Phil. ii. c. 32). This Dolabella, who was the third husband of
Cicero’s daughter Tullia, had joined Caesar in Β.0. 49, and had served
him at the battle of Pharsalus and in his African and his last Spanish
campaign. He was one of the insolvents of the day, and hoped to mend
his fortune. Caesar had none but worthless men about him. A usur-per
indeed can have no other company, for honest men must keep aloof.
Dolabella joined the murderers of his old benefactor, and for a time
Cicero had great hopes of his worthy son-in-law.

Antonius showed great cunning in these difficult circumstances. He
began by getting possession of the money that was in Caesar’s house
and of all his papers. On the 17th of March the senate was summoned
to the temple of Tellus, to decide what was to be done in the present
state of affairs. Cicero made a speech on this occasion, in which he
recommended an amnesty. His speech is not extant, but Dion (44, 6.

Damascenus (p. 29, ed. N. Piccolos‚ with a French translation), and probably with embel-
lishments. See also Phil. ii. c. 34.
