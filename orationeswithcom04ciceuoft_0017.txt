PREFAGE. xi

and he will often perplex his reader by the contradictory opinions
which he transfers to his notes. This is the case with the notes to
the variorum edition of Cicero's orations. They contain much
good matter, but the true and the false, the useful and the useless,
are heaped together in a way to bewilder the student. Ι have
not consulted every commentator whom I might have consulted,
or ought to have consulted. Sometimes Ι could not get a book
that I wanted, and sometimes Ι was ignorant of its existence. Ι
have however used the remarks of many commentators, some of
them the best; and I have consulted a great many books, princi-
pally German writers on Roman law and Roman constitutional
questions, which have not been used in this country, at least for
the explanation of Ciceros text. For the reasons which I have
mentioned and other reasons not necessary to mention. Ι add that
Ι know that I have explained some orations better than others.

My notes, Ι think, are sufficient in quantity. It is a great mis-
take to overload an ancient author with notes, and to leave nothing
for the teacher or the reader to do. We do not read, or we ought
not to read an ancient author for the notes, but notes ought to be
written and read to assist in understanding the text. There is
great danger now, and it is often the case, that people read about
antiquity and about ancient authors, and know little of the authors
themselves. If these writers are worth reading, they should be read
with as few notes as possible, and every man who has studied them
with proper care, and got over all such difficulties as a critical
study can conquer, will prefer reading them afterwards without any
notes at all, and reading them as he would read a book in his own
language, or in a modern language which he can easily understand.
Astudent requires many notes to some of the classical authors: for
the object of his study is a critical examinatiou of the author's
words, in order that he may iniprove himself in the language. and
pass through a useful and necessary discipline.

The faults both of omission and commission in a work like this
must be numerous, whatever pains au editor has taken ; and if he
has a reasonable share of modesty and judgment, nobody will know
these faults better than himself. Nothing is easier than to find
fault, but those who are disposed to do that and nothing else, must
