INTRODUGTION. 3

Ι have used for the texi: of this oration Halm’s edition, which is in
the second edition of Orelli, 1856.

The MSS abbreviations are as follow in Halm:
A = lemmata Sehol. Bob.
P z codex Parisinus 7794 ab Halmio collatus.
Gr z codex Gemblacensis nunc Bruxeliensis 5:345 a Baitero collatus.
S = codex Salisburgensis nunc Monacensis Lat. 15734 a me col-
latus.

I have also used Hahn’s edition of this oration, Leipzig, 1845, which
contains a selection from the notes of the best 'commentators on this
oration, among whom is Govezmus, and also notes of his own. Hahn’s
editions are always useful. His selections from the commentators on
this oration and his own remarks have saved me much labour ; which I
acknowledge most fully. I have also done my best} to explain whatever

Ϊ could.
