372 ORAT. PRO T. ANNIO MILONE

factorumu quam ipsa recte facta, se nihil in vita nisi praeclarissime
fecisse, siquidem nihil sit praestabilius viro quam periculis patriam
liberare; beatos esse quibus ea res honori fuerit a suis civibus, 1166
tamen eos miseros qui beneficio cives suos vicerint3 sed tamen ex
omnibus praemiis virtutis, si esset habenda ratio praemiorum,

absentes adessemus, mortui viveremus, 113116 denique esse cujus “

only passage that I can recollect in which
any intimation seems to 116 given of a
future reward is in the xvth chapter of
the Enchiridion3 and probably even there
he means only a happiness to be enjoyed
in the present life after due improvement
in philosophy, though he expresses it by
the very strong figures of partaking the
feasts and empire of the gods.'' This lady,
who made a tolerable translation of Epic-
tetus, has added to it very indifferent notes.
She could not look at her author im-
partially. The Stoic philosophy had now
got a footing in Rome, and it is a curious
inquiry to discover what its practical use
was. Cicero was no Stoic. He spoke
for the occasion, but still we may learn
from him something of opinion about
matters on which human affairs mainly
turn. The Stoics were divided in opinion
of another life, but their doctrine was
sound whether there is another life or not.
Improvement in virtue is conformable to
the nature of things, and he who has im-
proved in virtue is in a fit state to enjoy
another and a happier existence. And this
is the view of Bp. Butler (Vol. iii. Pro
Archia, e. 12, and the note).

yloriam] Ι have in several places touched
on Cicero's glory. Here it is the fame and
reputation which survive the man and by
anticipation console him in life. In the
Pro Marcello, 6. 8, 116 defines ‘ gloria ' very
well: “siquidem gloria cst,'' &c. The
French talk and write much of ‘ glory.' A
great deal of their glory is a very mean
trivial matter, below Cicero’s present defi-
nition, but contained in another definition
which I shall presently quote. The Eng-
lish are sparing in speaking of glory. Their
talk is more of profit, something more sub-
stantial than the Frenchman’s glory. Ideas
like glory, differently conceived by dif-
ferent nations, make a large part of their re-

spective character, and affect human affairs
much more than many people may suppose.

Cicero, who is little consistent in his opi-
nions, and, as 1 think, because he generally
took them from some of his Greek books,
and had no settled opinions of his own, has
a good passage on ⁶ gloria ' in the Tusculan
Disput. iii. 2. There is a ‘ gloria' which is
“solida res et expressa, non adumbrata:
ea est consentiens laus bonorum, incorrupta.
vox bene judicantium de excellente virtute :
ea virtuti resonat tamquam imago. Quae
quia recte factorum plerumque comes est,
non est bonis viris repudianda. Illa autem
quae se ejus imitatricem esse vult, teme-
raria atque inconsiderata, et plerumque
peccatorum vitiorumque laudatrix, fama
populariS‚ simulatione honestatis formam
ejus pulcritudinemque corrumpit. Qua
caecitate homines, quum quaedam etiam
praeclara cuperent, eaque nescirent nec ubi
nec qualia essent, funditus alii everterunt
suas civitates, alii ipsi occiderunt.'' This
second glory‚ the ape of the first, is Bona-
parte's glory.

Abrami, who surnishes references for
all these matters, refers to Aristotle's
story of Dion's attempt against Dionysius
(Politik, v. 10). “Dion said that he was
content to die in the enterprize even if
it did not succeed, for it would be an
honourable death to die in the attempt to
destroy a tyrant. He sought not power
nor reward, but fame (ὃόέα).” The pru-
dent philosopher knew men well, when he
said that very few are moved by such a mo-
tive, for the foundation of such a resolution
must be indifference to loss of life, which
would follow if a man should not succeed
in his attempt. Men however, he says
well, who would do such things must have
Dion’s notion, ‘¹ but it is not an easy matter
to find many men of that mind.⁷'
