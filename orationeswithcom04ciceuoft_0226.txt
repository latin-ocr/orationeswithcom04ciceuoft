204 ORAT. IN L. CALPURNIUM PISONEM

unus aestimator, unus venditor tota in provincia per triennium fru-
menti omnis fuisti. XXXVI. Quid ego rerum capitalium quaes-
tiones, reorum pactioneS, redemptiones, acerbissimas damnationes,
libidinosissimas liberationes proferam? Tantum locum aliquem
quum mihi notum [esse] senseris, tecum ipse licebit quot in eo genere
et quanta sint crimina recordere. Quid, illam armorum officinam
ecquid recordaris, quum, omni totius provinciae pecore compulso
pellium nomine, omnem quaestum illum domesticum paternumque
renovasti? Videras enim grandis jam puer bello Italico repleri
quaestu vestram domum, quum pater armis faciendis tuus prae-
fuisset. Quid, vectigalem provinciam, singulis rebus quaecumque
venirent certo portorio imposito, servis tuis [publicanis] a te factam
esse meministi? Quid, centuriatus palam venditos? quid, per tuum
servulum ordines assignatos? quid, stipendium militibus per omnes
annos a civitatibus mensis palam propositis esse numeratum? Quid
illa in Pontum profectio et conatus tuus? quid debilitatio atque
abjectio animi tui Macedonia praetoria nuntiata, quum tu 11011 so-
lum, quod tibi succederetur, sed quod Gabinio non succederetur,
exsanguis et mortuus concidisti ἓ quid quaestor aedilicius rejectus?
praepositus * *3 legatorum tuorum optimus abs te quisque violatus ἓ
went out. ‘Quaecumque venirent' means

nesus et.’ This is the Thracian Cherso-

nesus.

36. pactiones, redemptiones] Bargains
made with persons who were accused; and
sums of money paid by such persons (re-
demptiones) to get free. whether the
persons were guilty or innocent does not
concern us here. Cicero is speaking of the
corruption 0111151100.-έ armorum officinam :'
some place where arins were made. He
says that all the cattle of the province vvere
driven there ‘pellium nomine,' under the
pretext of getting a supply of skins; but
the real purpose was to get money. The
Romans required skins for 101115, and other
military purposes. (See Caesar, B. G. iii.
0. 29, ‘¹ ut. . diutius sub pellibus milites
contineri non possent;” aud Cic. Verr. ii.
2 0. 2.

, bello)1talico] He says that Piso's father
had made money in the Italic war (13.0. 90),
having had the superintendence of the
fabrication of arms, and at Rome, as some
modern writers say, but this passage does
not tell us where the manufactory was. The
Blarsic war eost Rome many men and much
money3 but war always brings profit to a
few knaves who seed on it.

portorio] Piso fixed duties (portorium)
011 goods which came into the province and

on all articles for sale. The word ‘ publi-
canis' is supposed by Bake to be a gloss,
and Halm has inclosed itin [ ]. Hotmann
once thought that the true reading was
‘publicis’ He made the province ‘vecti-
galis ' to his slaves.

centuriatus] Abrami proposed ‘ centurio-
See De Imp. Cn„ Pomp. c. 13,
Vol. ii. But ‘centurionatus' has a diffe-
rent mcaning. The ‘ordines' are 1110
order 01“ rank or precedence among the
sixty centurions of a legion, and this order
was determined hythe favour of a miserable
slave, a favourite of Piso. ‘ Assignare' is
the usual word for expressing the appoint-
nient of the Centuriones. Piso also made
the towns pay his soldiers; and we must
suppose kept the money which the ‘ aera-
rium ¹ allowed him for the pay of his troops.

Pontum] This is all that we know of
Piso’s expedition to the Pontus—‘Mace-
donia praetoria ι’ when he heard that 110
was supersederi by the senate having de-
clared Macedonia to be a Praetoria instead
of a Consularis Provincia (De Prov. Cons.).

praepositus] Something appears to be
lost after this word. Madvig writes ‘quid
quaestor aediliciis rejectis praepositus,’
which he explains thus: Though Piso had

natus!
