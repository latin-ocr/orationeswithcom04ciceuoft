PRO Τ. ANNIO MILONE

ORATIO.

INTRODUCTION.

Τ. ANNms MILO PAPIANUS‚ the son of C. Papius Celsus and his wife
Annia, was adopted by his maternal grandfather, T. Annius Luscus.
It is not known in what year 116 was Quaestor. He was Tribunus plebis
in Rc. 57 ‚ the year of Cicero’s return from exile, and 116 exerted himself
in favour of Cicero’s restoration. In B.0. 55 Milo married Fausta, the
daughter of the dictator L. Sulla, who is said to have had an intrigue
with C. Sallustius, the historian and preacher of morality.

From the time when Milo became a partizan of Cicero there was a
deadly feud between him and P. Clodius, Cicero’s great enemy. The
reason of Milo's attaching himself to Cn. Pompeius, and aiding him in
the restoration of Cicero, seems to hav: been merely a matter of per-
sonal interest. He was in debt, and wished to get the consulship and
a province, which in those days was the readiest way to repair a ruined
fortune. Milo resisted Clodius’ violence by violence. Both of them
surrounded themselves with armed men, and Rome was filled with their
bloody brawls.

Clodius was elected Aedile for the year B.0. 56. In Rc. 53 Milo
was a candidate for the consulship and Clodius for the praetorship. In
January Rc. 52 these two disturbers of the public peace met near
Bovillae, each attended by a band of armed men. The meeting was
probably accidental. A quarrel ensued, and Clodius was killed. The
circumstances are told by Cicero, and no doubt in the way most favour-
able to Milo, for Cicero’s answer to the charge against Milo is that he
acted in sels-defence.

The Introduction of Asconius states all the facts which are necessary
to enable a reader to understand this oration.
