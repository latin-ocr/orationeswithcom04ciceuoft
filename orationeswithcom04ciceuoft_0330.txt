308 ORAT. PRO O. RABIRIO POSTUMO

est : ductae naves Postumi Puteolis sunt, auditae visaeque merces.
Fallaces quidem et fucosae chartis et linteis et vitro delatae;
quibus quum multae naves refertae fuissent, una non patuerit parva.
* Χ· *⁴ Puteolanus sermo illius temporis vectorumque cursus atque
ostentatio, tum subinvisum apud malevolos Postumi nomen propter
opinionem pecuniae nescio quam aestatem unam non plures aures
refersit istis sermonibus.

XV. Verum autem, judices, si scire vultis, nisi O. Caesaris*
summa in omnes, incredibilis in hunc eadem liberalitas exstitisset,
nos hunc [Postumum] jam pridem in foro non haberemus. Ille
onera multorum hujus amicorum excepit unus3 quaeque multi
homines necessarii secundis Postumi rebus descripta sustinuerunt,
nunc ejus afflictis fortunis universa sustinet. Umbram equitis Ro-
mani et imaginem videtis, judices, unius amici conservatam auxilio
et fide. Nihil huic eripi potest praeter hoc simulacrum pristinae
dignitatis, quod O. Caesar solus tuetur et sustinet; quae quidem
in miserrimis rebus huic tamen tribuenda est maxima. Nisi vero
hoc mediocri virtute effici potest, ut tantus ille vir tanti ducat hunc
afflictum praesertim et absentem, et in tanta fortuna sua, ut aliena

commentators’ ingenuity. Klotz explains

teoli (In Vat. c. 5, and the note). Klotz
thinks that the ablative ‘ Puteolis ’ is right,
and that ‘Puteolos’ would not do, because
the ships called at Puteoli, or passed Pu-
teoli to go to Rome. But some ships might
go on to Ostia and some did stay at Puteoli,
which was a place of great trade with Egypt
(Acts Ap. c. ‘283 Sueton. Aug. e. 98, and
Casaubon's note.) Strabo (xvii.) speaks
of Puteoli, which he calls Dicaearchia, and
Alexandria, as the corresponding ports of
Italy and Egypt, and he means that ves-
sels sailed between these two places. I
reject Klotz’s explanation of ‘Puteolis'—

Fallaces] ‘Deeeitful wares and false, of
papyrus and linen eloth and glass brought
in there) According to this pointing
Cicero makes the remark ‘FallaceS,' διο.
What follows is corrupt, like a great deal in
this and in the preceding chapter. Halm
has ‘una non potuerit parva. Cataplus
ille PuteolanuS.' The Alexandrine fieet
which came to Puteoli was called Cataplus,
as in Martial (xii. 75, quoted by Casaubon),

“ Quulm tibi Niliacus portet crystalla eata-
p us. '

The labours of the critics at restoration are
not worth notice. They may be ingenious
and show acuteness and learning; but we
do not read Cicero in order to admirc his

all this passage in his way.

15. eadem] codd. Patricius proposes
‘eundem,' Halm prefers ‘ ejusdem! Hc
also writes ‘nos hune‚’ omitting ‘ Postu-
mum3' and remarks that Cicero calls him
either ‘ hunc' or ‘Postumun],' not both.
⁴ Summa in omnes ’ is the same as ‘ quae
summa est in onmes.'—⁴ in foro :³ he would
have lost his equestrian rank. He could not
have appeared in public.

descripta] This word is opposed to ‘uni-
versa,' and it must mean ‘ severally,' or ⁴ in
separate parts.’ What Postumus' friends
severally did for him in his prosperity,
Caesar alone did for him in his adversity.
We do not- know why C. Caesar was so
much interested in supporting Rabirius3
but we know that he wrote to Pompeius to
urge him to do what he could for Gabinius

iu his troubles, but in spite of Caesar's in· >

terest and Pompeius' exertions Gabinius
was convicted (Dion 39, e. 63). For ⁴ ho-

which means ⁴ merit.5

aliena] ‘ alienam,' Patricius, Halm.—
‘et tanta occupatione :' Halm added ‘ et.y
‘Occupatione' is an emendation of somo-
body, and a true one. The MSS. reading
is ‘oppugnatioue.’ The last words 01· the
