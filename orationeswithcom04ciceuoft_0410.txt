388 ORAT. PRO M. MARCELLO
nescio quo rei publicae misero funestoque compulsi, etsi aliqua
culpa tenemur erroris humani, [a] scelere certe liberati sumus.
Nam quum M. Marcellum deprecantibus vobis rei publicae con-
servavit, me et mihi et item rei publicae nullo deprecante, reliquos
amplissimos viros et sibi ipsos et patriae reddidit, quorum et fre-
quentiam et dignitatem hoc ipso in consessu videtis, non ille hostes
induxit in curiam, sed judicavit a plerisque ignoratione potius
et falso atque inani metu quam cupiditate aut crudelitate bellum »
esse susceptum. Quo quidem in bello semper de pace audiendum
putavi, semperque dolui non modo pacem, sed etiam orationem
civium pacem flagitantium repudiari. Neque enim ego illa nec
ulla uniquam secutus sum arma civilia, semperque mea consilia
pacis et- togae socia, non belli atque armorum fuerunt. Hominem
sum secutus privato officio non publico3 tantumque apud me grati
animi fidelis memoria valuit, ut nulla non modo cupiditate, sed ne
spe quidem prudens et sciens tamquam ad interitum ruerem volun-
tarium. Quod quidem meum consilium minime obscurum fuit.

the same thing here.

semper de pace . . . putavi] This is true,
as Cicero’s letters show (Ad Att. vii. and
viii.). He foresaw what the end would be:
“ Pace opus est. Ex victoria quum multa
mala, tum certe tyrannus exsistet’' (Ad
Att. vii. 5). Immediately on his return
to Rome from Cilicia, he expresses to Tiro
his desire for a settlement of the quarrel
between Caesar and Pompeius (Ad Div.
xvi. ll .

pose to erase ‘socias—‘hominem’ the
man emphatically (see Index, Vol. iii..)
He means Pompeius. Wolf's objection to
⁴ hominem’ is groundless (see Quum Sena-
tui, e. 9, and the note).

The excuse is good for nothing, if he
thought Pompeius was wrong. Some edi-
tions have ‘privato consilio,' but I do not
know what is the authority for ‘consih'0.'
In two of his letters to Atticus (viii. 3;
ix. 7), Cicero says that Pompeius’ cause is
that of the State, and that it is ‘optima;
sed agetur, memento, fi›edissime.' He
hardly knew his own mind. He was in a
state of most horrible perplexity, when
Caesar invaded Italy and Pompeius left it:
“Non sum, inquam, mihi crede, mentis
conipos; tantum mihi dedecoris admisisse
videor,'’ διο. (Ad Aa. ix. 6.) In truth, he

There was wrong on both sides, but he
believed that Caesar would use iictory with
more moderation, and that was a good rea-
son for joining him.

hoc ordine] ‘in the senate.’ Ι don’t
know if ⁴ ordo‘ is used to signify the place
where the senate met. ¹ Integra re :’ before
Caesar crosrsed the Rubicon. In a letter to
Atticus (ix. 7), Cicero speaks of the danger
of proposing peace, and says that Pompeius
desired to get the power which Sulla had
held. Plutarch (Cicero, c. 39) has a story,
that after the battle of Pharsalia, “ Cato,
who had a large army at Dyrrachium, and
a great fleet, asked Cicero to take the com-
mand according to custom, and as he had the
superior dignity of the consulship. But as
Cicero rejected the command, and altogether
was averse to joining the armament, he
narrowly escaped being killed3 for the young
Pompeius and his friends, called him a
traitor and drew their swords, but Cato
stood in the gap, and with difficulty rescued
Cicero, and let him go from the army.''
The suspicions were true. Cicero returned
to Brundisium, and waited there anxiously
for letters from Caesar, and he waited at
Brundisium till Caesar arrived there from
the East in September, 13.c. 47. In the
mean time he was trying to conciliate him
(Ad Att. xi. 6).
