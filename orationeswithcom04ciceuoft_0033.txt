' beneficio sed consulis extremum adhaesisse?

GAP. 4, 5. 11

Quaesturam petisti cum P. Sestio, quum hic nihil loqueretur
nisi quod agebat, tu de altero consulatu gerendo te diceres cogitare.
, Quaero abs te teneasne memoria, quum P. Sestius quaestor sit
cunctis suffragiis factus, tunc te vix invitis omnibus non populi
In eo magistratu,
quum tibi magno clamore aquaria provincia sorte obtigisset, mis-
susne sis a me consule Puteolos, ut inde aurum exportari argentum-
que prohiberes? In eo negotio, quum te non custodem ad conti-
nendas, sed portitorem ad partiendas merces missum putares,
quumque omnium domos, apothecas, naves furacissime scrutarere,
hominesque negotii gerentes judiciis iniquissimis irretires, merca-
tores e navi egredientes terreres, conscendentes morarere, teneasne
memoria tibi in conventu Puteolis manus esse allatas, ad me con-

sulem querelas Puteolanorum esse delatas?

as this.’—‘ sordibus tuis 2’ here he means the
meanness of his way of living. See c. l.

P. Sestio] He was the quaestor of C.
Antonius, Cicero's colleague in the consul-
ship (Pro Sestio, c. 3).-ι nisi quod agebat :’
he spoke of nothing except the business in
hand, the (piacstorsliip, while Vatinius was
talking even about a second consulship.

non populi beneficio] The office con-
ferred by the popular vote was said to be
given by the ‘beneficium ' of the Pop. Rom.
(Verr. ii. l, c. 5, note; Pro Murena, c. l.)
It could not be eonferred by the ‘bene-
ficium ' of the Consul in the same sense in
which it was conferred by the Populus, by
a vote. It was therefore done some other
way, and the plain conclusion is that of
Feri-atius, that it was done by fraud, by a
false return. ‘He stuck 011 at the end ’
(extremum adhaesisse). Manutius remarks
that there were now twenty quaestors under
a Lex enacted in Sulla’s time, the number
before him having been eight. (Tacit.
Ann. xi. 22.)

aquaria provincia] It cannot be the
Ostiensis Provincia (Pro Murena, c. 8), as
some suppose. The context shows that it
was Baiae, a place of resort for its hot
springs, whence it was sometimes called
the waters (aquae) (Pro Plancio, c. 27 ; ad
Att. xiv. 12). The people did not like this
Provincia falling to 'the lot of Vatinius,
because he would have the care of the im-
ports, and particularly of the corin—⁴ Puteo-
los :’ it was a great emporium in Cicero's
time. as Festus (Paul. Diae. p. 1:22, Muell.
quoted by lluhn) says: ‘⁶ Minorem Delum
Puteolos esse dixerunt, quod Delos uli-
quando maximum emporium fuerit totius

orbis terrarum, cui successit postea Puteo-
lanum, quod municipium Graccum antea
Δικαιαρχία vocitatum est.'' See De Lege
Agraria, ii. 31 ; Strabo xvii. p. 793.

aurum exportari] So in the oration
Pro Flacco, c. 28, the Jews were forbidden
to export the preeious mmals. The Romans
tried to keep the gold aud sih-er in Italy,
hut they could not. The eoin was wanted
to pay for the imports into Italy. They
had nothing else to buy them with. Vol.
ii. The Province Asm, p. 288.

,vm-morem] The ‘portitores ’ were those
who farmed the custom-house duties; and
they had the right of demanding the. port
duties, or taking, we may suppose, an
cquivalent out ot* the goods themselves (ad
partiendas merces).—‘ apothecas :' the ware-
houses which Vatinius rummaged, as Cicero
says.

neyotii florentes] “negotium G. corr.
m. 2 ” (llalm). See Pro Sestio, c. 45.—⁴ in
conventuz’ ‘conventus’ signities both a
place in a. Provincia where men met to have
their disputes settled in court, and also
the nieeting ot' the people sor that. purpose.
But Halm observes that Puteoli wasa Prae-
fectura, and that there is no evidence thot
the. courts held in l’raet'eeturae were ever
called ‘ conventus? Abrami supposed thnt
this was a ‘conventus negotiatorum,' a
meeting ot* the merehnnts at Puteoli sor
purposes os business. llermann supposes
it to hc the body μί’ tlu- coloni ot⁸ Puteoli
(consilium publicum) who niet tor tiu·
