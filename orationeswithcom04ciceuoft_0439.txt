GAP. 10, 11. 417

beatiores illi [esse] videantur interdum, qui tua liberalitate fruuntur.
quam tu ipse, qui illis tam multa coneedas3 sed video tamen apud
te caussas, ut dixi, rogantium valere plus quam preceS, ab iisque te
moveri maxime, quorum justissimum videas dolorem in petendO.

In Q. Ligario conservando multis tu quidem gratum facies neces-
sariis tuis; sed hoc, quaeso, considera, quod soles. Possum fortis-
simos viros Sabinos tibi probatissimos, totumque agrum Sabinum
florem Italiae ac robur rei publicae proponere. Nosti optimos
homines. Animadverte horum omnium maestitiam et dolorem:
hujus T. Brocchi, de quo non dubito quid existimes, lacrimas squa-
loremque ipsius et filii vides. Quid de fratribus dicam? Noli,
Caesar, putare de unius capite nos agere. Aut tres tibi Ligarii
retinendi in civitate sunt, aut tres ex civitate exterminandi. Nam
quodvis exsilium his est optatius quam patria, quam domus, quam
dii penates, uno illo exsulante. <Si fraterne, si pie, si eum dolore
faciuntg moveant te horum lacrimae, moveat pietas, moveat ger-
manitas; valeat tua vox illa [quae vicit]; te enim dicere audie-
bamus nos onmes adversarios putare, nisi qui nobiscum essent; te

The form of the thought is this: Though
you are so liberal, still I see that the mo-
nives of those who solicit you have more
weight than their entreaties, ‘ and that you
are most moved by those whose sympathy
with the unfortunate, expressed in their
petitions (⁶ dolorem in petendo ’)‚ you ob-
serve to have the best foundation!

Sabinos . .. aarum Sabinum] Cicero
rhetorically speaks of the whole Sabine
racc, though only a few were present.
These men of the highlauds were the flower
and strength of Italy:

‘¹ Ilaec genus acre virum Marsos pubem-
que Sabellam ”
(Virg. Georg. ii. 167);

and Horace (Curm. iii. 6, 37) and others
commemorate their martial qualities:

‘⁴ Sed rusticorum mascula militum
Proles Sabellis docta ligonibus
Versnre glebas.’'

optimos homines] There is an inferior
reading ‘optimu' (lnesur may have had
many of these fighting men in his legions

vooe illa] The words which heis going to
mention. Lambinus says that the MSS. have
⁴ quae (1ίοίῒῇ and he suspects that ‘quae vieit,’
or ⁴ quae dicit ‘ is foreign to the matter aud
an interpolation. Baiter says nothing about
it. We can do better without the addition.

‘nos omnes] Suetonius (JuliuS‚ c. 75)ss
‘⁴ Denuntiante Pompeio pro hostibus so
habiturum qui rei publicae defuissent, ipse
(Caesar) medios et neutrius partis suorum
sibi numero futuros pronuntiavit.” Pom-
peius’ threat was a serious one, for he
would have mas-sacred or proseribed those
who did not join him, if he had been viv-
torious; and Cicero in his letters says so.
Caesar was wiser. In his book on the Civil
war (i. c. 33) Caesar says what Suetonius
does. Cicero writes to Atticus (xi. o) atter
l‘ompeius' death : ⁴¹ L. vero Lentulus llor-
