hac tribuaria, non intelligo quamobrem senatus hoc uno in genere
tribus edi voluerit ab accusatore neque eandem editionem tra-ns-

* tulerit in ceteras caussas, de ipso

denique ambitu rejectionem fieri

voluerit judicum alternorum, quumque nullum genus acerbitatis

praetermitteret, hoc tamen unum praetereundum putarit.

Quid,

hujusce rei obscura caussa est, an et agitata tum quum ista in
senatu res agebatur, et disputata hesterno die copiosissime a Q.

Hortensio, cui tum est senatus assensus?

Hoc igitur sensimus :

cujuscumque tribus largitor esset per hanc consensionem, quae

‘aecum,' which is the reading of T., and a
common way of writing. See the note on
⁴ quum’ and ‘ cum,' Verr. ii. 3, c. 31,
Vol. i.

hac tribuaria] ‘In this matter of the
tribes,’ the naming of the tribes (editio)
from which the J udices were to be taken.—
· de ipso . . . ambitu :¹ 11 Plancius had been
prosecuted under any of the Leges de Am-
bitu, the form of proceeding would have
been different. The Schol. Anibros. says:
‘¹ Differentia igitur accusatoris ostenditur
ideo invadentis in legem Liciniam, quod
ambitus probari non possit, de quo judices
ex rejectione haberi soleant, aequalem scili-
cet numerum rejicientibus tam accusatore
quam reo.’¹ See also In Vatin. 0. ll.

ista in senatu res] This deliberation in
the Senate took place when the Setum was
made, pur-suant to which the Lex Licinia
was proposed. Hortensius, who defended
Plancius, had spoken before Cicero, and he
had explained the object of the Lex. ‘ Cui
tum’ must refer to the time when the
Sctum was made. Cicero continues, ¹ Hoc
igitur sensimus :’ ‘ this is what we meant,'
we, the Senators, when we passed the
Sctum ; and he then goes on to state, using
the indirect form (esset, &c.), what the
Senate meant by the Setum. His talk is
however nothing to the purpose, for when
we interpret a Law we do not turn to the
debates which preceded the enactment in
order to learn what was the purpose 01 the
Law, but we look only to the words of the
Law itself, and to its purpose.

Cicero says that the Senate thought that
if any man had corrupted a tribe, the fact of
the corruption would be best known to the
men of the tribe. This 15 so plain that we
might have found it out without Cicero's
help. Accordingly the Senate thought that
if the accused wcre tried by a jury taken
from thc tribes which 11011811 corrupted, the
same men would be both witnesses and
jury. But the Senate might have considered

that if the J udices happened to be the men
who had voted for the briber, they might
happen to aequit him contrary to their own
knowledge. This is a hard form of trial
(acerbum judicium); but still, says Cicero,
if the defendant’s own tribe, or a tribe with
which he was most closely connected, was
chosen as one of the tribes to take the jury
from, the defendant could not object. All
this is said to prepare the way sor the next
chapter.

per lianc consensionem] ‘If a man
bribed any tribe by means of that asso-
ciation, which is called more honourably
than truly by the name of Sodalitas;’
which means, if he used the ‘sodalitates’
for election purposes. XVunder stit-ks to
his old explanation: ⁴ Consensio’ significs
those whom the candidates gained over in
order to get the votes, in a word ‘so-
dales,’ as it plainly appears from the words
‘ quae nominaretur.' — “ 115 honiinibus‚'
&e.: Wunder says, ‘that is, those who
were not bribed; 101· 118 who was guilty of
Sodalicia had by no means given money to
all the men of any tribe which he had
desired to gain.' How does 118 know that
118 had not given money to all? lt is true
that he would give no more than he could
help, but he would give 85 11111011, 11 110 had
it, as was necessary to secure the vote of
the tribe, and to as many of the ‘ tribules '
as were necessary3 but, 85 1 suppose, he
would not pay 11 118 did not get his elec-
tion. If 8 candidate bribed 8 part, we can-
not assume that the men to whom hc had
not given money would always know that
he had given money to others. Cicero
means this; there might be men among the
jury who would know the fact 01 brihcry.
and how could they know it so well 115 by
having been bribed ?—¹Bcing guilty os
Sodalicia' is 811 inaccuratc expression.
W'c might as well say that 8 111811 is “ guilty
of a club.' But Cicero says (c. 19). ‘'in
hoc sodaliciorum tribuario criuiine.'' The
