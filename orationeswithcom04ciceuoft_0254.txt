G. Serranum, stultissimum hominem,—fuit enim tamen nobilis,—
non C. Fimbriam7 novum hominem, fuit enim et animi satis magni
et consilii,—se‹l Cn. Manlium, non solum ignobilem, verum sine vir-
tute, sine ingenio, vita etiam contempta ac sordida. Desiderarunt
te, inquit, oculi mei quum tu esses Cyrenis; nie enirn quam socios
tua frui virtute malebam3 et quo plus intererat, eo plus aberas a
me; mecum te non videbam. Deinde sitientem me virtutis tuae ἱ
deseruisti ac reliquisti. Coeperas enim petere tribunatum plebis
temporibus iis quae 'istam eloquentiam et virtutem requirebant3
quain petitionem quum reliquisses, si hoc judicasti, tanta in tem-
pestate te gubernare non posse, de virtute tua dubitavi3 si nolle,
de voluntate. Sin, quod inagis intelligo, temporibus te aliis reser-
vasti, ego quoque⁷ inquiet populus Romanus, ad ea te tempora
revocavi ad quae tu te ipse servaras. Pete igitur eum magistra-

sulship B.c. 10⁵2. Catulus lost his elec-tion
for the consulship when Cn. Manlius7 or
Mallius, got it in B.c. 105, as we learn from
the oration Pro Murena (c. 17). Catulus
also lost his election when C. Atilius Ser-
ranus and Q. Servilius Caepio were chosen
consuls B.c. 1063 and in 13.c. 104, when
C. Flavius Fimbria and C. Marius were
elected consuls, Marius sor the second time.
The reason why Cicero 1135 altered the order
of time in his enumeration of the defeats of
Catulus, seems to be that he wished to put
the greatest defeat last: first a man who
was ⁴ nobilis ' was preferred to Catulus,
then a ‘novus,' and then an ‘ignobilis’
(Wunder).

Cn. Manlium] Wunder writes ‘ Cn.
Mallium’ on the authority of two MSS.
See the note on the Pro Murena, c. 17.
Τ. Ε. have ‘ Manlium ' here, and Baiter.

Cyrenis] Laterensis had been quaestor
in Cyrene (c. 26).—-‘ quo plus . . . eo plus :’
‘the more it was for my interest to have
the benefit of your services, the further you
kept away from me.' Some of the critics
have found a difficulty here, and explained
‘plus' incorrectly. The sense is as plain
as it can be, though the expression cannot
be translated literally. Wunder has ex-
plained it right.—‘a nie; mecum te non
videbam ε’ this is the emendation of Fritzsch.
T. E. have ⁴ a me cum te.' Wunder has ⁴ a
me: certe te non videbam,' following Gara-
toni and Orelli.

tribunatum] Laterensis was a can-

didate for the tribuneship in 13.c. 59, the
consulship of Caesar, but he desisted from
his canvass that he might not have to take
the oath which the Agraria Lex of Caesar
about the land of Campania required of
the candidates, as Cicero tells us in a letter
to Atticus (ii. 18): “Habet etiam Cam-
pana Lex exsecrationem in contione (ed.
Orelli) candidatorum, si mentionem fece-
rint quo aliter ager possideatur atque ut ex
legibus Juliis. Non dubitant jurare ce-
teri: Laterensis existimatur laute fecisse,
quod tribunatum pl. petere destitit ne
juraret.” Cicero alludes to this in the
beginning of c. 22.-—-‘gubernare:⁷ Orelli
thought that ‘gubernare’ could not be
used absolutely, and he thought that it.
ought to be ‘gubernare rem publicam!
But- this is a kind of criticism which is
very poor. All analogy would lead us to
suppose that most active verbs can also be
used without a case after them3 and
Wunder quotes two instances of ‘guber-
nare’ being used as it is here: De Off. i.
25, and Phil. ii. 36.

ludi] “¹1⁴⁷cdz'T., iudices E.'’ (Baiter).
‘Ludi' is Ernesti’s correction, and it is
quite certain. For, as Garationi remarks,
I and L are often confounded, and ‘ju-
dices’ is often written ‘iudx Nothing
then is so natural as for the corruption
‘iudi’ to be made into ‘iudices,' a word
which is quite inconsistent with the sense
of the passage.
