10 ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

is plain enough from this passage: ‘ the
office was conferred with such good-will on
the part of the Roman people on a few and
on me.’ Like many expressions in common
use this was sometimes used with less gram-
matical exactness3 but the meaning was 1111-
derstood. Caesar (Β. G. i. 28) says: “ quos-
que postea in parem juris libertatisque con-
ditionem atque ipsi erant receperant.”

in honore] Iu his election to the quae-
storship (c. ὃ), and his rejection, when 118
was a candidate for the aedilesbip (8. 16).—
‘ in salute ε’ 011 1115 trial, for his prosecution
by C. Licinius Calvus was already begun,
says the Scholiast, whom Mommsen correct-s
by stating that Calvus had not commenced
the prosecution, but was preparing it.

tecum] ‘sed ut tecum cum ’ Ρ. ‘sed ut
tecum’ G. The common reading is ⁴ sed
ut cum homine.’

ηοη solum '¹ 'f *] I have followed Halm
here. There is something wanting in the
text.-‘ viris his quos vides :' the judices on
the trial of P. Sestius (Manutius).

hoe responderis] Garatoni warns us
against altering this to ‘ad hoc,’ and so
making it like ¹ respondeto ad ea ;' and 118
refers us to c. 7, “simul etiam illud volo
uti respondeat,’' and 8. 17. A man who
has read carefully would never think of
altering ⁸ 1108 responderis,’ which is a com-
mon form. Garatoni compares it with the
Greek rostro ἀποκρίνεσθαι. Caesar says
‘ his respondere ’ and ⁴ ad haec respondere.’

isla quaeinflala rumpantur] Lambinus

wrote ¹ ista ilia quae,’ ¹ ilia ’ being added by
Giunta. Cicero means the man's arrogance
and the ⁴ nimius tumor animi ¹ as the Scho-
liast says, and also his personal deformity,
his ‘ strumae.’

memoriter] ‘fully and truly‚’ so as to
forget nothing, as Madvig explains it Ad
Cic. de Finibus, p. 74 (Halm); who also
refers to what Seyffert says ou this word
(Cicero, Laelius, p. 9). Seyffert says that
the proper signification of ‘memoriter ' is
⁴ ex memoria‚' ⁴ out of a man's own recol-
lection.' That ‘ memor ' and ‘ memoriter '
should by virtue of the context imply ‘ fully
and truly ’ is simple ; but Seyffert is right
in looking to the primary meaning, and so
we shoqu here. Cicero says, ⁴ then out of
your memory answer.’ What else was he
to answer from? He is told to answer as ,
well as his memory will serve him. Itis
plain from the questions put to him, that
he would neither answer fully nor ti uly, if
he did answer ; nor would Cicero expect an
answer. But he tells him to consult his
memory and do his best. ἢ

5. parietes . . perfoderis] What the
Greeks named τοιχωρυχεῖν, to break into
houses and rob. These men the Romans
called ⁴ effractores! Hermann warns us
against suppossng that Cicero charges Vati-
nius with these particular offences. If any
reader feels the necessity of the warning,
he has it.—‘ hoc praemii ε’ ‘ hoc praemium ’
G. But the genitive is the genuine form
here ε ‘ Let your worthlessness get so much
