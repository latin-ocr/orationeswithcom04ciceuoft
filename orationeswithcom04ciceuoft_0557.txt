TO THE THIRD PHILIPPIG. 535

forces assembled at Arretium. Appian erroneously says that they were
assembled at Alba (B. O. iii. 47 3 but compare B. O. iii. c. 42). His force
’ consisted of the two legions which had deserted Antonius, two which he
had raised among the veterans in the 0010111οΞ, and one legion newly levied.
The senate had no troops, and were glad to accept Caesar’s offers of
help ; Caesar had no authority and wished to have a regular commission
from the senate. Though Cicero had advised the boy to go to Rome, he
was very irresolute about going there himself. He did not know what to
do, as his letters to Atticus show. When Antonius left Rome, Cicero
could safely return, but he wished to be first assured of Caesar's disposi-
tion, that he would not be hostile to the murderers of the tyrant, and that
he would even be friendly to them. Oppius assured him that it would be
so. However, 110 says (Ad Att. xvi. 15) that it was not publio matters
that moved him at present: he had money matters which required his
presence at Rome, and he must come even into the midst of the
flames. He did come on the 9th of December. On the 10111 1110 tri-
bunes entered on their office3 and on the 20111 Cicero declared himself
openly against Antonius and in favour of Caesar in his third Philippic.
