potuit esse princeps, qui maluerit esse popularis. Sed homines aut
propter indignitatem suam diffisi ipsi sibi, aut propter reliquorum
obtrectationem ab hujus ordinis conjunctione depulsi, saepe ex hoc
’ portu se in illos fluctus prope necessario contulerunt. Qui si ex illa
jactatione cursuque populari, bene gesta re publica, referunt as·-
pectum in curiam atque huic amplissimae dignitati esse commendati
volunt, non modo non repellendi sunt, verum etiam expetendi.

praesertim monitus asapientissimo consule et diligentissimo custode
pacis atque otii, tamen vehementius arbitror pertimescendum, si homi-

popularis] See Vol. i. Index, ⁴ popularis)

Manutius remarks that it is either a blunder,

Here we plainly see that Cicero considered or Cicero has used the word improperly, for
Caesar to have been a Popularis. Now there the ‘ senatus decernit,' and the ⁴ populus ju-

was an opportunity of reconciling him to
the senate. Cicero says to Lentulus (Ad
Fam. i. 9) : “ quum etiam Caesar rebus
maximis gestis, singularibus ornatus et novis
honoribus ac judiciis senatus ad auctoritatem
ejus ordinis adjungeretur.”

fortissimo viro . . consule] Hotmann says
it is the consul L. Philippus ς but other
commentators with better reason think that
Cicero means Lentulus. Abrami quotes a
letter to Cicero's brother (Ad Q. Fr. ii. (i) :
‘⁴ Consul est egregius Lentulus non impe-
diente collega, sic, inquam, bonus ut melio-
rem non viderim.’' Philippus was con-
nected with Caesar, for he had married Atia
the mother of him who was afterwards
Augustus, and the daughter of Caesar’s
sister J ulia. He had also given his daughter
Marcia to M. Cato.

This consul expressed his fear that as the
populus had given Gallia Citerior to Caesar
by the Lex of Vatinius, they might give the
province again to some Popularis, who might
use his dangerous proximity to Rome to
disturb the state. lt was wise therefore
for the senate to seize the present oppor-
tunity of making Gallia citerior a Consularis
provincia. The word ‘ decernatur,' which
is generally added before ¹ post,' is not in C.
1 do not know what authority there is for it.

bet! Madvig quoted by Baiter says the same.
The remark is true as everybody knows who
has read Cicero. Halm proposes ⁴ obveniat.’

C'. Julius] This is not a usual way of
mentiouing a man. No ναι-11111011 is noted
by Baiter.

per manus tradat] As if ithad been sug-
gested that Caesar would keep the province
of Citerior Gallia to the end of his five
years, and then hand it over to some man
to whom the populus had given it, and tu a
successor not appointed by the senate. ⁴ Pur
manus ’ is used in various ways. Cicero
(Ad Att. i. 12) says “ P. Clodium per manus
servulae servatum et eductum.⁷’ Caesar
(B. G. vi. 38) uses “ aegre por manus tractus
scrvatur” (and Β. C. i. 68). Its original
sense then is ⁴ from hand to hand ς’ and the
fear was that Caesar might pass this province
from his own hands to anotlier's,1wrlmps
surreptitiously. Abrami says that the vx-
pression seems to smell of a proverb, ns in
a letter of Cicero to Caesar (vii. 5), in
which 111· is rccommcnding Trebonius : ⁸· ‘1¹0-
tum (leuique hominem tibi trado, (11· 111111111,

this is not quite 1111· same thing. This vx-
pression is tho origin of the Fronch ⁴ 111· 111
