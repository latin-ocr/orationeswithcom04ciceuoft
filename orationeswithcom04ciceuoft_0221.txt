sensisse quae me scio ; sed tamen, quod jam de eo his audientibus
saepe dixi, me ille sui totius consulatus, eorumque honorum quos
cum proximis communicavit socium esse voluit, detulit, invitavit,
rogavit. Non sum [ego] propter nimiam fortasse constantiae
cupiditatem adductus ad caussamg non postulabam, ut ei carissi-
mus essem, cujus ego ne beneficiis quidem sententiam meam tra-
didissem. Adducta res in certamen te consule putabatur, utrum
quae superiore anno ille gessisset manerent, an rescinderentur.
Quid loquar plura? Si tantum ille in me esse uno roboris et

these measmes, and Caesar, who knew it,
stayed at the gates of Rome (3.0. 58) till
Cicero went into exile. All this shows

in consulatu] Catilina formed a plot to
kill the consuls L. Cotta and L. Torquatus;
but it was discovered and failed (Introduc-
tion to >the Orations against Catilina, p. 2,
Vol. iii. .

servare] “Omnes libri scripti habent-
salvare,· quod quamvis non placet, testa-
tum voluimus'' (Faernus). Halm does not
notice this.—‘ generum ε’ C. Caesar.

De Prov. Cons. c. 17.—‘ honorum ι’ Caesar
proposed to Cicero that he should be one
of the commissionem for dividing the Cam-
panian land, and he wished to attach Cicero
to his party.—‘ constantiae cupiditatem ι’
his desire to maintain his consistency. to
stick to the party of the Optimates. and
not to join Caesar (ad caussam Caesaris).

pis opinions (sententiam) even for Caesar's

into Gallia and leave Cicero in Rome; and
Cicero says it in what follows: ‘ Si tantum '
&c. He tells us in all but express words
that Caesar took a part in driving him
from Rome, though he let others appear as
the active agents. Cicero handles this de-
licate matter with great skill. He stops
short, for he could say no more without
saying too much: ‘Sed praeterita mitto.’
‘ Mitto' is the reading of T. C. has

Cn. Pompeius] He was roused at last
by his own interest to exert himself for
Cicero's recall from exile.—¹ senatus :’ T.‚

dative. The genitive means ‘ he maintained
the opinion of the senate.'—‘ hujus volun-

have Caesar's consent to Cicero’s recall. aud
P. Sestius undertook to see Caesar about it,
and paid him a visit at the eud of n.c. :ut or
