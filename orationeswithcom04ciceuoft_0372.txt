21. Aqe nunc] He calls Clodius ‘ expe-
ditus latro‚' a robber unincumbered with
weight, as the Romans called soldiers on
the march ‘ expediti' when they were ready
for the fight. Milo was like the ‘impe-
dimenta,’ he moved with incumbrances.
“ Nam quod ad hostes appropinquabat, con-
suetudine sua Caesar sex legiones expeditas
ducebat” (B. G. ii. 19). Halm refers to
Quintilian (V. 10, 450: “intuendae sunt
praecipue in conjecturis (i. e. in caussis con-
jecturalibus) et facultates: credibilius est
enim occisos a pluribus pauciores, a fir-
mioribus imbecilliores,⁷' &c.

In the speeches of Isocrates there is a
rhetorical argument founded on probabili-
ties (πρὸς Εὐθύνουν α’μάρτυρος). One
man had deposited with another three
talents. The receiver had returned two
talents‚ but he denied that he had received
any more. The argumentation founded on
the payment os the two talents could be
used ingeniously for both sides (c. 12, 13).
There was no external evidence, and ac-
cordingly, says Isocrates, civriyacn ἐκ τεκμη-
ρίων καὶ ἡμᾶς διδάσκειν καὶ ὑμᾶς δικάζειν
ὁπότεροι ἀληθῆ λέγουσιν. If this was a
real case, the decision was not difficult.
The judge could make no decision, which
circumstance would, however, be a decision
in favour of the defendant. When there is
no evidence, when we have only the affirma-
tion of the plaintiff on one side and that of
the defendant on the other, there ought to
be no decision. There is, however, gene-
rally some fact, which may be used as
evidence on one side or on the other, and
this fact helps to a conclusion. Isocrates
in his rhetorical argument, however, sup-
poses that there was no evidence at all.

castra Etrusca] “ Saepe objecit Clodio
Cicero socium eum conjurationis Catilinae
fuisse, quam rem nunc quoque reticens
ostendit. Fuerat enim opinio, ut Catilina
ex urbe profugerat in castra Mallii centu-
rionis, qui tum in Etruria ad Faesulas
exercitum ei comparabat, Clodium eum
subsequi voluisse et coepisse, tum dein
mutato consilio in urbem rediisse'’ (Ascon.).
There is no evidence that Clodius was im-
plicated in Catilina's conspiracy, nor does
Cicero ever say so, though he uses expres-
sions which may be understood to mean
that Clodius was implicated. Clodius seems
to have had lands in Etruria.

symphoniacos] See Vol. i.‚ Index.
Halm asks, why is ‘uxoris’ added? If
they were his wife’s slaves, that is an
answer. They and the ‘ancillae' were
hers. Such slaves, singers and musicians,
were articles of luxury among the wealthy
Romans. Klotz refers to the oration Pro
Roscio Amer. c. 41 and c. 46, and fol-
lowing Abrami, he refers to Dion Cassius,
48, c. 44, who speaks of a prattling youth
being present at the marriage feast of
Livia and Octavianus: παιδίον τι τῶν
ψιθυρῶν, οἷα αὶ γυναῖκες γυμνὰ ὡς πλή-
Θει α’Θὺρουσιιι τρέφουσι. The train of
women here mentioned was of course for
the service of the great lady. VVhere
slaves are used, more persons are required.
Each waiting woman has her duty. This
lady would have dress-makers, hair-dressers,
and women for every eonceivable use.—
‘lupasz' Juvenal (iii. 65) tells what a
‘lupa’ is:

——“ et ad Circum jussas prostare puellas.
Ite quffiptqaggata est picta lupa barbara
