108 ORAT. DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

dederit, id senator properet auferre. Alter belli Gallici rationem
habet; fungitur officio boni senatoris: legem, quam non putat, eain
quoquo servat; praefinit enim successori diem. Quo mihi nihil
videtur minus a dignitate disciplinaque majorum quam ut qui consul
Kalendis -J an. habere provinciam debet, is ut eam desponsam, non
decretam habere videatur. Fuerit toto in consulatu sine provincia,
cui fuerit antequam designatus est decreta provincia? Sortietur
an non? Nam et non sortiri absurdum est, et, quod sortitus sis
non habere. Proficiscetur paludatus? Quo? Quo pervenire ante,
certam diem non licebit. Januario, Februario provinciam non
habebit. Kalendis ei denique Martiis nascetur repente provincia..
Ac tamen his sententiis Piso in provincia permanebit. Quae quum
gravia sunt, tum nihil gravius illo, quod mulctari imperatorem demi-
nutione provinciae contumeliosum est, neque solum summo in viro,
sed etiam mediocri in homine ne accidat providendum.

XVI. Ego vos intelligo, patres conscripti, multos decrevisse
eximios honores O. Caesari, et prope singulares3 quod ita meritus
erat, grati, sin etiam, ut quam conjunctissimus huic ordini esset,
sapientes ac divini fuistis. Neminem umquam est hic ordo com-
plexus honoribus et beneficiis suis, qui ullam dignitatem praestabi-
liorem ea quam per vos esset adeptus putarit. Nemo umquam hic

Alter] The senator who proposed to let take that province in B.c. 54, was not to

Caesar keep Gallia Ulterior and to take
from him Citerior.- ‘ legem, quam non
putat ε’ 113 maintains the Lex of Vatinius,
though he does not think that it is a Lex.
He adds for ‘he fixes a day for Caesar's
successorg’ and the day as he tells us was
the first of March, not the beginning of the
ear.

y Quo mihi . . minus] ¹ Quo ’ is the emen-
dation of Manutius, who also proposed
‘ magis ’ for ⁴ minus! The passage is cor-
rupt. Madvig has ‘ Quo mihi nihil alienius,’
which Baiter accepts.

Kal. Jam] A consul ought to have his
provincia secured to him when he entered
on his office on the first of January ; instead
of which he would have a promise of it
(desponsam), like 3 wife promised, but not

ot.
g Fuerit toto in] ‘Must the consul be
without a province during all his consul-
ship, though a province was assigned sor
him before he was elected! If the propo-
sitions were voted‚ some two provinces
would be assigned to the consuls who would
be elected for the next year (B.c. ὃὸ). But
as to Citerior Gallia, the consul who was to

have it as his till that year, and not at the
beginning of the year. He was to have the
promise of it instead of having it named as
his.

Sortietur] The two consuls determined
by lot or otherwise agreed which of the two
consular provinces each should have. Cicero
asks how could they decide by lot about a
thing that was not in their power.

paludatus] See Ver. ii. 5, 0. 13, Vol. i.

Kal. Martiis] So that the five years of

Caesar's occupatiori of Gallia Citerior should
be completed3 for he means the first of
March after the expiration of the consulship
of those consuls who should be elected in
B.c. 56, the year when this speech was
s oken. ,
pAc tamen] ‘And stillis these proposi-
tions are carried Piso will remain in his
province. ’—‘ Quae quum gravia :’ ‘ quae’
seems to refer to all that he has said.—
‘ mulctari imperatorem : ' that is Caesar.

16. Sinyulares; quod] ⁴ Singulari quod'
C. Gruter wrote ‘singularesz si quod‚'
which Baiter has followed. Gruter also
