GAP. 32, 33. 513

quid vitii in auspiciis futurum sit nisi qui de caelo servare constituit?
quod neque licet comitiis per leges, et, si qui servavit, non habitis
comitiis, sed priusquam habeantur debet nuntiare. Verum impli-
cata inscitia impudentia est, nec scit quod augurem, nec facit quod
pudentem decet. Atque ex illo die recordamini ejus usque ad Idus
Martias consulatum. Quis umquam apparitor tam humilis, tam
abjectus? Nihil ipse poterat: omnia rogabat: caput in aversam
lecticam inserens beneficia quae venderet a collega petebat.
XXXIII. Ecce Dolabellae comitiorum dies, sortitio praero-
gativae: quiescit. Renuntiatur: tacet. Prima classis vocatur:
renuntiatur. Deinde, ita ut assolet, suffragia 3 tum secunda classis
vocatum quae omnia sunt citius facta quam dixi. Confecto ne-
gotio bonus augur—C. Laelium diceres—‘alio die‚' inquit. Ο
impudentiam singularem! Quid videras, quid senseras, quid au-
dieras? neque enim te de caelo servasse dixisti, nec hodie dicis.
Id igitur obvenit vitium, quod tu jam Kalendis J anuariis futurum
esse provideras et tanto ante praedixeras. Ergo, hercule, magna,
ut sperO, tua potius quam rei publicae calamitate ementitus es
auspicia, obstrinxisti populum Romanum religione, augur auguri,

clear. He says, “Neque qui servare de
eaelo constituit magis divinare potest quid
in auspiciis vitii futurum sit, quam is qui
non constituit servare de caelo.’' This is
true. Neither of them could tell what the
result would be. Antonius had said many
months before, which is an exaggeration of
Cicero, that he would either prevent the
Comitia ‘ auspiciis,’ or that he would do what
116 did (vel vitiare). Cicero sayS, “Can
any man divine what defeet there will be
in the Auspicia, unless he has made up his
mind ‘servare de caelo? ” Of course 116
6011111 not. Antonius had resolved that 116
would ‘servare de caelo‚’ and that 116 would
see what he was resolved to 566.

per loyes] The Lex Clodia (11.6. 58) had
repealed the Aelia et Fufia (Pro Sestio,
c. 153 and Quum Senatui. 6. 5, and tho
notes). Halm supposes that Cicero in
the words 4 per leges’ refers 1ο 1116 Lex
Clodia. He does not suppose that the Lex
Clodia was really repealed, hut that without
paying any regard to it, they had returned
to the old practice. llowever that may he,
Cicero informs us, (hut he ‘ qui servavit (16
caelo’ must do it, not after the Comitia
are held, but before they hegin. To do 11,
aster would be an absurdity. for the pur-
pose of the observ-‘itinn was tu nseertuin if
the Comitia could be properly held.

in aversam lecticam] lle represents

v01.. lv.

Caesar as carried in his ‘ lectica,' and Anto-
nius putting his head into it to present a
request to his colleague, whose face he did
not: see, for he respectfully put iu his head
at the back part. The reading of D. is ‘ad-
versam.’ V. has 4 aursam.'

33. praeroyativae] The ‘sortitio' was
to determine which ‘ centuria ' should vote
first. See Praerogativa, Index, Vol. i.-—-
‘ renuntiatur :’ the vote of 1116 Praero-
gativa is reported. The first class is called ;
the vote is reported. The words ‘ deinde, ut
assolet . . . vocatur’ are very obscure. V.
has ⁴ suffragiatum,' out of which ‘ suffragia
tum’ has been made (Halm). The words
⁴ deinde, ut assolet ' seem very idle words,
when they merely mean that the second
611155 votes after the first. A. Augustinus’
suggestion 111111. we should read ⁴ deinde ut
11550161, suffragatum secunda classis vocatur’
seems to me as good 115 any3 but the idle
words 1116 there still.

(1. Laelium] lle was au augur, and he
was called Sapiens. lle was the friend of
the younger Africanus. When all was over
Antonius calls out ⁴ alio die,’ the formal
words by which tho proeeedings were (16-
elured to be viiiated. Cicero asks him what
116 had seen (11· heard which disturbed the
‘ silentium ’ that was requisito 1111116 411115-
pi‹·.ia,' for he did not pretend 111111 116 had
⁶ servasse de caelo!
