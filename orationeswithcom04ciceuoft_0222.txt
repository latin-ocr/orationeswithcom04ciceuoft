200 ORAT. IN L. CALPURNIUM PISONEM

daboribus, vitae periculis complexus est, quum municipia pro me
adiret, Italiac fidem imploraret, P. Lentulo consuli, auctori salutis
meae, frequens assideret, senatus sententiam praestaret, in con-
tionibus non niodo sc defensorem salutis meae, sed etiam supplicem
pro me profiteretur, hujus voluntatis eum, quem multum posse
intelligebat, mihi non inimicum esse cognorat, socium sibi et
adjutorem O. Caesarem adjunxit. Jam vides me tibi non inimi-
cum, sed hostem, illis quos describis non niodo non iratum, sed
etiam amicum esse debere; quorum alter, id quod meminero
semper, aeque mihi fuit amicus 36 sibi; alter, id quod obliviscar,
sibi aliquando amicior quam mihi. Deinde 1106 113 fit, ut viri
fortes, etiam si ferro inter 56 60111111115 decertarint, tamen illud 60114
tentionis odium simul 611111 ipsa pugna armisque deponant. Neque
me ille odisse potuit umquam, ne tum quidem quum dissidebamus,
Habet hoc virtus, quam tu 116 de facie quidem nosti, ut viros fortes
species ejus et pulchritudo etiam 111 110516 posita delectet.
XXXIII. Equidem dicam ex 31111110, patres conscripti, quod
sentio, et quod vobis audientibus saepe jani dixi. Si mihi num-
quam amicus C. Caesar fuisset, si semper iratus; si aspernaretur
amicitiam meam seque mihi implacabilem inexpiabilemque prae-
beret3 tamen ei, quum tantas res gessisset gereretque quotidie,
non amicus esse 11011 possem. Cujus ego imperium, non Alpium
vallum contra ascensum transgressionemque Gallorum, non Rheni
fossam gurgitibus illis redundantem Germanorum immanissimis
gentibus objicio et oppono; perfecit ille, ut si montes resedissent,

Caesar might suppose that after such a lesson
Cicero would not readily oppose him iu any

place of ‘legatus’ in his army in Gallia,
and if Cicero had accepted it, Caesar

thingimmediately after his return to Rome,
which was in September B.c. 57.

quorum aller] Cn. Pompeius. The other
(alter) is Caesar, who, as he says, only
looked after his own iuterests, when he con-
sented to Cicero being driven from Rome,
knowing, as it is clearly implied, that if
Cicero stayed there was danger that his
measures would be attacked, while he was
busy with the enemy north of 1116 Alps.
There is no evidence so clear as 11131 con-
tained in this chapter as 10 1116 part which
Caesar took in driving 'Cicero out of Rome.

odisse umquam] This may be true.
Caesar perhaps did not hate Cicero, for the
magnanimous man is not a good hater. Nor
did he despise him altogether. He knew
that Cicero could do him harm at Rome,
and that he had the inclination. He was
resolved not to leave him in Rome when he
went to his province. He offered him the

would have been safe against him, for he
would have had him in his power. Cicero
refused the place and intended to stay in
Rome, and Caesar would not allow that.

de facie] ⁴ by sight! Piso had never
even seen ‘ virtus ς’ or he did not know her
when he saw her, for he had great examples
before his 65165, Cicero's ‘ virtus ’ for 111-
5131166, which even Caesar admired.

33. Cujus eqo imperium] ‘T. et Oxou
H.' (Halm), as Lambinus had proposed to
read. The other reading is ⁴ imperio.' He
says, ⁴¹ Ι oppose his imperium, and not the
rampart of the Alps to the ascent and inva-
sion of the Galli‚'’ &c. It was usual to call
the Alps the wall and rampart of Italy.

yuryilibus illis] A common use of ⁴ ille τ’
“the Rhine overflowing with its enormous
volume of water.''—‘ si montes resedissent :’
compare De Prov. Cons. c. 14. Ε. G. have
⁸ residissent.’
