de praevaricatione] The offence of ‘ prae-
varicatio ’ consisted in not honestly prose-
cuting a man, but acting the prosecutor in

such way as to insure his acquittal (De
Divin. c. 18, Vol. i..) There is nothing in-

existimariR Ferratius has explained this
better than Manutius, who misunderstood
it. Ferratius adds by the way that 11101111-
nesses were examined at'ter the ‘oratores ’
had made their speeches; but he says that

consistent in Vatinius having charged Al-
binovanus with ‘praevaricatio‚’ and at the
same time saying that Sestius ought not to
have been prosecuted ς but there was an in-
consistency in saying all this, and saying
that Sestius ought to have, been convicted
(ea lege condemnari putes oportere). 130-
tween the first question and the conclusion,
‘ sed hoc quaero,' Cicero interposes a ques—
tion about Milo. He asks if Vatinius had
said that Milo's case was all one with that
of Sestius (‘ cum 1100 ’ is equivalent to ‘ cnm
sestii caussa ')‚ and if he had said that
Cicero’s defence of Sestius was approved by
honest men. Cicero does not stop to show
the inconsistency between the man's talk
and 1115 evidence, but 119 does it 111 a manner
by saying, that Vatinius gave his evidence
against those measures of Sestius (hujus
actiones) which he affirmed to be approved
by the good, and here we have the incon-
sistency between ‘quac pro me a Sestio
facta sint' &c., and ‘quas hujus actiones . . .
dixisti) In the words ‘quicum autem
hujus caussam . . . extulisti ' we have the
contradiction to ‘etiam illud dixeris. . .
VOL. lv,

in the case of Repetundae this was done
after the first actio, and that this appears
from Verres’ case.

quicum autem hujus caussam] Compare
the words ‘conjunctam cum hoc) ‘Quicum'
15 Milo: ‘ hujus ’ is Sestius. Garatoni pro-
posed ‘liujus,‘ and Orelli accepted it. No
MSS. authority for ‘ hujus ' is quoted. Mad-
vig objects to ‘ hujus? lIe says Sestius
having once been mentioned (quas hujus
actiones), the other 111-01101111 (ejus) 15 used,
referring to the former. This is doubtless
the correct use of “ ejus,' but in this passage
the repetition of ⁴ hujus ' seems necessary ς
not necessary for the sense. bnt necessary
to give the proper soree to what the orator
says.

si . . . com—uli noles] By the form of
the question ‘num . . . qua lege ' &o t'ieero
aslx's Vatinius' opinion; bnt he sarenstivully
adds, if you do not ehoose to liare ⁴voni·
opinion asked3 lie himself of 0011150 not
thinking Vntinius' opinion worth any thing.
Aeeordingly he 011115 by nsking him about a
fact, and not for his opinion.
