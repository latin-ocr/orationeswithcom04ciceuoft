OAP. 11-13, 683

quem Antonius deliciarum caussa loris in convivio caedi jubebat a
servis publicis: septemvirales, Lento, Nucula; tum deliciae atque
amores populi Romani L. Antonius; tribuni primum duo designati,
Tullus Hostilius, qui suo jure in porta nomen inscripsit, qui quum
prodere imperatorem suum non potuisset, reliquit 3 alter est desig-
natus Insteius nescio qui, fortis ut aiunt latro; quem tamen tempe-
rantem fuisse ferunt Pisauri balneatorem. Sequuntur alii tribunicii,
T. Plancus in primis, qui si senatum dilexisset, numquam curiam
incendisset; quo scelere damnatus in eam urbem rediit armis, ex
qua excesserat legibus. Sed hoc ei commune cum plurimis sui
simillimis. Illud tamen verum, quod in hoe Planco proverbii loco
dici solet : perire eum non posse, nisi ei crura fracta essent. Fracta
sunt, et vivit. Hoc tamen, ut alia multa, Aquilae referatur accep-
tum. XIII. Est etiam ibi Decius, ab illis, ut opinor, Muribus

“ Diruptus, morbo herniae3 dirutus, aere
alien0.’' This is in Cicero’s fashion to
make personal allusions.—‘ Cotyla Varius ε’
see Phil. v. c. 2, and the note.

deliciarum caussa] “ Deliciarum et vo-
luptatis caussa,’' Pro Rabir. Post. c. 10. It
seems that he means that this was done to
amuse Antonius. Manutius says, ‘⁴ Ut ei
delicias faceret. injuriam Antonii quasi
studium in Cotylam nominat ;'' and he re-
fers to Phil. viii. c. 8: “ Si vero tum fuit
aedilis, quum eum jussu Antonii in convivio
servi publici loris ceciderunt.” ⁴ Facere
delicias alicui ' means to insulta man. An-
tonius then took a pleasure in having Cotyla
whipped, and we may guess how much Co-
tyla would relish it.

septemvirales] Members of the commis-
sion of seven for the distribution of land
under Antonius' Lem—⁴ tribuni :’ Ferra-
rius’ emendation for ‘ tribunicii.’—‘ in porta
nomen . . . qui quum :' ‘ qua, quum ' Rau,
Halm. ‘¹ Quasi portam (Mutinae), ut opi-
nor, qua proditionem frustra molitus ad
Antonium fugisset. quamque inde faceti
homines portam Hostiliam dicerent, ut tri-
umphalem post tantum facinus nomine suo
dedicasset ’' (Orelli). 1 do not know if
this is right. Manutius says, ⁸¹ in porta
quae Hostilia dicebatur: jure igitur quo-
dam suo iu porta nomen suum inscripsit.''
1 do not know what Porta he meanS.

temperantem] He is playing on the
word. ⁶ Temperare aquam ’ means ¹ to
warm the water for the bath,’ to give it the
proper heat; and ‘temperans,’ as Muretus
says, also means σαόφρων.

Τ. Plancus] lle was Tr. pl. in the year
in which Clodius killed Milo. Sec Asco-
nius’ Introd. to the Pro Milone about the

burning of the Curia, p. 316 ς and Phil. vi.
c. 4, and the note.——‘ rediit armis :’ he was
restored by Caesar, who is accused by Cicero
of pardoning au the rascals. except Milo.
sui simillimis] The MSS. have ⁴ dissi-
millimis.y Pighius, “in fastis ad annum
v.c. nccu conjecit sibi simillimis” (Gru-
ter). Halm properly changes ⁴ sibi ¹ to ‘sui.’
verum] ‘ mirum ¹ Klotz, Halm. The
MSS. have ‘uerum,’ which might be con-
founded with ‘mii-um! In place of ‘ve-
rum ’ there have been proposed ¹ proprium.'
⁴ minus verum.’ ‘ non verum,' and ‘ minime
verum.' 1 think ‘verum ¹ may be right.
At least it is as plain as ⁴ mirum‚’ which is
supposed to stand in opposition to ¹ com-
mune!
crura sraela . . . Aquilae] See Phil. xi.
c. 6, and the note. He could never be
killed, it was said, unless his legs were
broken. (See Vol. iii. Index, ‘Crurifra-
gium.') Perhaps the words ⁴ perire eum'
may allude to T. Plancus having fought as
a gladiator at Caesar's gamos, ac. 45, to
which the passage in Cicero's letters (Ad
Div. xii. 18) is supposed to allude: “ Equi-
(lem sic jam obdurui ut ludis Caesaris nostri
animo aequissimo viderem T. Plancum, au-
direm Laberii et Publii poemata.''—⁴hoc
tamen ε’ not Plancus' being alive, for which
we are indebted to Aquila, but his having
broken his leg or his legs. That is some-
thing. His legs were broken, but not in
the way that the people meant.
13. Decius] See Phil. x. 6. lle plays
on the word ‘ Mus ’ when lie says ⁴ munera
rosit.'—‘Saxain:' see Phil. viii. c. 3. and
xi. c. 5.—‘ alter Saserna ι’ perhaps lie means
⁴the other Saserna,' sor there werc a Sn—
serna father and son (Columella, i. 1).
