TO THE PHILIPPIOAE. 447

an equal and a man of spirit. Pliny's letters to Trajan are much more
dignified.

Cicero’s last great speech (13.6. 52) was in defence of Milo, who had
killed Cicero’s enemy, P. Clodius. We have not the speech which he
delivered, but a speech which he wrote and published. The circum-
stances under which this speech was made give it somewhat of the cha-
racter of a political address3 and it shows that while he tried to assume
a bold countenance, he was cowed by the power of Pompeius, who was
then sole consul.

We have only three speeches which were delivered during Caesar’s
usurpation3 the speech Pro Marcello, which I assume that we do not
possess in its genuine form, and the addresses to C. Caesar in defence of
Ligarius and Deiotarus. Caesar was now the master of the Roman state,
and Cicero humbled himself before the man whom he feared and hated.

The collection of Cicero’s letters is said to contain 877 1; among which
letters there are about one hundred from different persons to Cicero.
Though this collection is only a small part of what he wrote, it is very
valuable for the history of the times and for Cicero’s biography3 and
many of these letters help us to understand his orations better. The
earliest of Cicero's extant letters is one to Atticus, written in the year
after his aedileship, Β.6. 68. The latest is a letter from Plancus to
Cicero, dated near the end of J uly, B.c. 43. In the month of December,
Rc. 43, Cicero was assassinated, being at that time near sixty-four years
os age.

O. Caesar, whom Cicero flattered in his speeches for Ligarius and
Deiotarus (13.6. 46 and 45), was murdered in the senate-house on the
15th of March, 13.c. 44. Cicero was not among the conspirators‚ for
they could not trust him, and had not let him into their secret. But he
was in the senate-house on the l5th of March, and he saw Caesar mur-
dered, and he was delighted with the bloody spectacle (Ad Att. xiv. 14,
§ 4 ; Phil. ii. c. 11, &c.). The deed, he says, was done with the spirit
of men; but, as 116 soon saw, the assassins were only boys in counscl
(Ad Att. xiv. 21). He would have gone further if he had been “ invited
to the noble festival of the 15th of March: we should then have had no
leavings'’ (Ad Div. x. 28, ξ 1); instead of playing one act only, he
would have finished the whole play (Phil. ii. c. 14); 116 would have
killed M. Antonius, Caesar's colleaguc in the consulship (11.6. 44). This
letter is addressed to C. Trebonius one of the conspirators, who engaged
Antonius in conversation before the senate-house while the bloody work
was going on within. Plutarch (Anton. 6. 13) gives one reason for
Antonius’ life being spared, and Cicero (Phil. ii. 6. 14) gives a different,

Those who are curious and have time may count them.
