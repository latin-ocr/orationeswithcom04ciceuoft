vocas, sed etiam amicissimi tui legem esse contemptam, apud quem
tu etiam nos criminari soles, qui illi sumus amicissimi, quum tu
ei contumeliosissime toties maledicas, quoties te illi affinem esse
dicis.

Atque etiam illud scire, ex te cupio, quo consilio aut qua mente
feceris, utin epulo Q. Arrii familiaris mei cum toga pulla accum-
beres? quem umquam videris, quem audieris, quo exempIO, quo
more feceris? Dices supplicationes te illas non probasse. Optime.
Nullae fuerint supplicationes Videsne me nihil de anni illius
caussa, nihil de eo, quod tibi cum summis viris commune esse
videatur, sed de tuis propriis sceleribus ex te quaerere? Nulla
supplicatio fuerit. Cedo, quis umquam caenarit atratus? Ita enim
illud epulum est funebre, ut munus sit funeris, epulae quidem ipsae
dignitatis. XIII. Sed omitto epulum populi Romani, festum diem,
argento, veste, omni apparatu ornatuque visendo: quis umquam in
luctu domestico, quis in funere familiari caenavit cum toga pulla?

amicissimi tui] Caesar. He maybe speak-
ing irouically, or he may intend to show the

bration, the gladiatorial games and the
dinner, while the ‘epulae' is the dinner

inconsistency of Vatinius, who disregards
the Lex ofthe man whom he calls his dearest
friend. Vatinius, it is said, married Antonia,
a daughter of M. Antonius Creticus This
Antonius had to wife Julia, the daughter of
L. Julius Caesar, consul B.c. 9ος and so
Vatinius became an affinis. as the Romans
understood the term, of C. Caesar (consul
B.c. 59), who was of the same family as the
mother of Vatinius’ wife.

Q. Arrii] Arrius gave a great feast to the
people on the occasion of his father’s death,
and in Castor's temple (c. 13). The mag-
nificence of this entertainment became pro-
verbial, and hence the allusion in Horace
(Sat. ii. 3. ν. 85, and 243, and Macleane’s
note) ι

“ Ni sie fecissent, gladiatorum dare centum
Damnati populo paria atque epulum arbi-
trio Arri.''

—‘ supplicationes :' Vatinius might be sup-
posed to say that he kept his dark dress (toga
pulla), because lie would show that he did
not approve of the ‘supplicationes' which
C. Pomptinus had asked for on account of
his victories in gallia Narbonensis in a.c.
⁴52 (Dc Prov. ons c. 13). Caesar and
his friends opposed the demand of (Σ. Pomp-
tinus, for Caesar wished to have all the
glory of conquering Gallia himself.

epulum . . . epulae] Halm remarks that the
‘epulum ' here is the whole funeral cele-

only. The ‘ munus ' is the show of gladia-
tors. Cicero says: “The ‘ epulum ’ is so
far funereal, that the show of gladiators is a
part of the funeral, but the feast itself is for
the honour of him who gives it.'’ Accord-
ingly a man might be present at the show
of gladiators in a dark dress, but he ought
to have a light dress at the feast (Abrami).

13. festum diem] On ⁴ dies festi ' a man
ought to appear ‘albatus,’ in a bright-
coloured dress, as Horace says (Sat. ii. 2.
60, quoted by Abrami) :

‘⁴ Ille repotia natales aliosque dierum
Festos albatus celebret,’'—

and Macleane's note.—‘ ornatuque visendo :'
that is, decoration worth looking at.

balineis] P. G. The common form is
‘balneis’ The dinner-dress was given to
a man when he left the bath to go to dinner.
After a funeral the bath was a form of
purification (Abi-ami). 'l'he‘epuli domiuus*
is Arrius. The giver of the entertainment
is often simply called ‘dominus,’ llor. (sat.
ii. 8. v. 92) ε

“ Suaves res, si non caussas narraret

earum et
Naturas dominus (Nasidienus).”
