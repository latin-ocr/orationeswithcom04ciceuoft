TO THE PHILIPPIOAE. 449

winter quarters at Bibracte at the end of December. In the following
year Antonius had the opportunity of making himself useful to Caesar,
and learning something of the art of war. In Ro. 50 Caesar sent Anto-
nius to Rome, to be a candidate for the augurship, in which he was
successful, with the help of the tribune Curio; and thus he became a.
colleague of Cicero, who was also an augur. In the same year he was
elected Tribunus plebis, and the year of his office was the year B.c. 49,
in which Caesar invaded Italy. Antonius and his colleague Q Cassius
Longinus, at a meeting of the senate, put their veto on the proposal of
Q. Metellus Scipio, to declare Caesar an enemy if he did not dismiss his
army before a certain day 3 but the veto was not regarded, and the two
tribunes left Rome on the 7th of J anuary (13.0. 49), and joined Caesar.
Antonius was appointed a Legatus of Caesar3 and after Pompeius had
left Italy on the 17 th of March, Antonius and Cassius returned to
Rome with Caesar, and resumed their office. When Caesar set out for
Spain in April, Bc. 49, he left Antonius, with the title of Propraetor, in
command of the troops in Italy, and with orders to prevent any persons
from passing over the sea to Pompeius. Antonius wrote to Cicero an
affectionate letter (Ad Att. x. 8), in which he entreats his beloved friend
not to cross the sea, and to believe that he loved him better than any
body except his dear Caesar. In another letter to Cicero, written in a
different tone (Ad Att. x. 10), Antonius tells him that he has Caesar's
orders to allow no man to leave Italy, and that he cannot permit it; but
he advises Cicero to ask Caesar's permission, and he says that he has no
doubt that Cicero will obtain it, especially as he promises to have regard
to his friendly relations to Caesar and Antonius. Cicero however left
Italy without permission.

Antonius acted in an arbitrary manner in Italy during Caesar‘s ab·
sence, and he seandalized the Romans and Italians by his loose way of
living (Phil. ii. c. 23, &c.). Caesar took no notice of this on his return
to Rome: he could not afford to lose so useful a man. When Caesar,
at the end of B.c. 49, crossed the Adriatic to follow Pompeius, Antonius
was left to bring over some legions from Brundisium, which he suecess-
fully accomplished. He joined Caesar before Pompeius' camp at Dyr·
rachium, where he distinguished himself, and he commanded thc left
wing at the battle of Pharsalus (nc. 48). After this battle Antonius
was sent to Italy with some troops to keep the country quiet. Ho
landed at Brundisium, where he found Cicero, who had returned from
Epirus. Antonius might have punishcd or at least driven hini out of
Italy, but he let him alone (Phil. ii. c. 3, 24, 25; Ad Att. xi. 7).

In the first part of Rc. 47 Caesar was still absent from Italy, but ho
was appointed Dictator a second time, and M. Antonius, his Magister
Equitum, exercised authority in Rome. Thiugs were in a very nnquict
