440 ORAT. PRO REGE DEIOTARO

tyrannum . . . scriberet ?] Of course
Blesamius could not have written such a
falsehood. But after Caesar's death Cicero
wrote it, and the writing remains (Ad Att.
xiv. 6).

Cicero says ironically ⁶ Multorum enim‚'
&c.‚ ‘ enim ' being used here as ‘ scilicet ’ is
sometimes used. The ‘capita‚' says Patri-
cius, are heads without bodies 3 but Cicero
means heads fixed on the Rostra and in
public places, which Rome had seen once,
and saw again shortly after, and Cicero’s
head among others (De Orat. iii. 0. 3 ; Ρ3101-
culus, ii. 19; Plutarch, Marius, c. 34, 35,
and Sulla, c. 10).

Nam cle statua] ‘ For as to the statue 3'
he passes lightly over this with a ‘Nam ’
(Pro Archia, c. 10, and ‘the note). He
says ‘Who complains of a statue when
there are so many? ' A statue is not so
much as a trophy. Then he comes to the
real matter: ‘ Now if it is the place where
the statue is fixed that is complained of,
there is no place for a statue more conspi-
cuous than the Rostra;’ and Caesar’s was
in the Capitol. Abrami remarks that Cicero
eludes rather than answers the objection
“per fallaciam, ut loquimur, accidentis;'’

for the unpopularity arose not from the
statue being in a conspicuous place, but
because it was ‘inter reges3' and Caesar
had also two statues on the Rostra (Dion,
44, 0. 4 .

De pgausu] It seems 35 if Cicero ad-
mitted that there was not much applause,
that Caesar in fact was looked on as a
usurper‚ or was not popular. The reason
that Cicero gives for there being no ap-
plause is a piece of the meanest and silliest
flattery that ever came from a man, even
from him. It is in the style of the adula-
tion paid to James I., whom Bacon places
above Caesar and M. Antoninus “in all
literature and erudition, divine and human.”

But Cicero made amends by what he
said of Caesar after his death (Phil. ii. c.
32) and elsewhere.

13. praetermissum] ‘ praeteritum' Halm.
— ‘ ad extremum caussae ’ is the reading
of the MSS„ as they are quoted, ex-
cept one. Halm has this reading (ed.
1853), but in the later edition of Orelli he
has the reading which is in the text.

Id autem aliquid] ‘Id aliquid’ 15 311
expression of Terence, and ⁴ is aliquis ¹ oc-
curs in the Pro Ligario, 0. 7. Halm writes,
contrary to the MSS„ ‘Id autem quid
est? te ut' &c.
