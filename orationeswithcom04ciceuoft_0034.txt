ulteriorem Hispaniam] Spain at this
time was divided into two Provinciae ( Pro
Fonteio, c. 7). The subdivision of Ulterior
into two parts, one of which was called
Lusitania, was made in Augustus’ time.

pro consule] C. Cosconius was praetor
in Cicero's consulship. and afterwards had
the Ulterior Hispania, with the title of Pro-
consul. Pto Sulla, c. 14. In c. 7 another
C. Cosconius is mentioned, who was a col-
Ιαξηε of Vatinius in his tribunate, and a
J udex on the trial of Sestius.

pedibus confici] The Romans generally
went to Spain by land, through the south
of France3 bui: the shortaet road to the
Ulterior Provincia was by sea. However
Vatinius ought to have gone direct to his
province. Abi-ami quotes Ulpian, De Officio
Proeonsuh's, Dig. l. 16 4, §5: “Ingressum
etiam hoc euin observare oportet, ut per
ampartemprovineiae ingrediatur, perquam
ingredi moris ἐπ” διε.

Hiempsal' s kingdom3 for Caesar defended
(nc. 62) at Rome an African prinoe
Masinissa orMasintha against the claims of
this Numidia king Hiempsal (Drumann.

Gaechmhte Roma, iii. 135).

Mastanesosz] Nobody knows what this
is. The ‘ fretum ' is the strait of Gibraltar,
which Vatinius crossed to pass into Spain.

jam inde] Garatoni could not under-
stand this ‘inde’ It refers to the very
beginning of Vatinius’ tribunate: ‘And I
give you notice now from the commence-
ment of your tribunate not to mix up your
dirty tricks with the high reputation of the
most illustrious men.¹ The most illustrioris
is C. Caesar, whose tool Vatinius was in
Caesar's consulship Bne 59, the year of
Vatinius’ tribunate. Cicero was now on
good terms with Caesar, who was pursuing
his victorious career in Gallia, or he
thought it prudent to pretend that he was.
(13.e. 56). Cn. Pompeius too was now
Caesar's son- in- law; and Pompeius had
helped to Cioero' s restoration.

per tuum latus] Abrami quotes Livy
40, c. 9: ‘nec pei· meum latus tu
He would not wound Caesar through Van
tinius.

6. Pythayoreum] The Scholiast speaks
of Nigidius Figulus, a Pythagoream of this
time, ‘ ad quem plurimi conveniebant-¹ Py-
