GAP. 33, 34. 275

dicere, amicitiam meam voluptati pluribus quam praesidio fuisse3
meque vehementer vitae meae poeniteret, si in mea familiaritate
locus esset nemini nisi litigioso aut nocenti.

XXXIV. Sed haec nescio quomodo frequenter in me conges-
sisti saneque in eo creber fuisti, te idcirco in ludos caussam conji-
cere noluisse, ne ego mea consuetudine aliquid de tensis misericor-
diae caussa dicerem quod in aliis aedilibus ante fecissem. Non
nihil egisti hoc loco; nam mihi eripuisti ornamentum orationis
meae. Deridebor si mentionem tensarum fecero, quum tu id prae-
dixeris: sine tensis autem quid potero dicere? Hic etiam addi-
disti me idcirco mea lege exsilio ambitum sanxisse, ut miserabiliores
epilogos possem dicere. Non vobis videtur cum aliquo declamatore,
non cum laboris et fori discipulo disputare? Rhodi enim, inquit,
ego non fui : me vult fuisse: scd fui, inquit,—putabam in Vaccaeis
dicturum—bis in Bithynia. Si locus habet reprehensionis ansam
aliquam, nescio cur severiorem Nicaeam putes quam Rhodum: si
spectanda caussa est, et tu in Bithynia summa cum dignitate fuisti,
et ego Rhodi non minore. Nam quod in eo me reprehendisti, quod
nimium multos defenderem, utinam et tu qui potes, et ceteri qui

34. Sed llaec . . . [licere] This pas· Rhodi enim] The Schol. Ambros. re-

sage is obscure, and Wunder admits that
he cannot explain it. The point turns on
this. Laterensis is supposed to have de-
prived Cicero of some common-place, which
he would have introduced as usual. Late-
rensis did not choose to throw the trial of
this case into the time when the Ludi Ro-
mani were celebrated, in order that Cicero
might not use his common-place about the
⁴ tensae’ or ‘thensae.' (See Verr.ii.5‚ c. 72
and the note.)

ambitum . . . epiloqos] The Lex Tullia
made the penalty ten years' exile (Intro-
duction). The true reading ‘exsilio am-
111111111 sanxisse' is due to the sagacity of
Garatoni, and it is confirmed by the lemma
of the Schol. Ambros. There is a sample
of Cicero's ‘ epilogi ¹ in the oration Pro Mu-
rena, c. 41, which was delivered after the
enactment of the Lex Tullia.

videtur] This is Wunder's reading and
Baiter's, in place os the common reading,
⁴ videor.' ‘Videtur ' is the reading of E.
and of somc 1111161· MSS„ and the better
reading. Cicero means to say that Late-
rensis considers him a declamator, and not
a man brought up in 1116 1011 of the Forum.
Sec Index, Vol. iii. Dc‹·lamatio; and Orat.
c. 14: “non 6111111 declamatorem aliquem
de ludo aut rabulam dc foro. scd doctissi-
mum 61 perfectissimum quaerimus.”

T

minds us that Cicero when he was a young
man went to Rhodes to improve himself in
oratory under Apollonius, named Molo.—
‘ in Vaccaeis :’ among the Vaccaei, a Spanish
people. lt is not material whether this is
1116 right reading or not. Laterensis says,
¹ Well, Ι never was at Rhodes ¹ . . ‘ but I
have been—I thought he was going to say
among some people totally ignorant of the
rhetorical art.’ We must not conclude
from this that Laterensis had been in Spain,
nor can we accept Niebuhr-'s proposal to
read ‘ Barcaeis,' because Laterensis had been
quaestor 111 Cyrene (c. 5 and 2¹5). How-
ever, Laterensis said that he had been twice
in Bithynia in a military capacity, as Fer-
ratius conjectures ; and it may be so.
Nicaea was the chief town in Bithynia.
Cicero says that his purpose 111 going 10
Rhodes was as honourable as Laterensis'
purpose, whatever it was, in 11611111,Γ 111 Nicaea.

defenderem] The reading of A. T. E
has ¹ defcnderim,' as Baiter says. wandol-
says that. it has ‘defendet-em.y XVnndcr
explains the differencc between 1116 1116111111111
of the two words. ‘Nimium multos dv-
fenderiin ’ would mean ⁴ for having defended
too many,' which would 1101, includo 1111· de-
fenee of Plancius. But 1116 word< ‘¹¹01'
