328 ORAT. PRO T. ANNIO MILONE

cepimus, legimus, verum ex natura ipsa arripuimus, hausimus, ex-
pressimus, ad quam non docti scd facti, non instituti sed imbuti
sumus, ut, si vita nostra in aliquas insidias, si in vim et in tela aut
latronum aut inimicorum incidisset, omnis honesta ratio esset ex-
pediendae salutis. Silent enim leges inter arma nec se exspectari
jubent, quum ei qui exspectare velit ante injusta poena luenda sit
quam justa repetenda. Etsi persapienter et quodam modo tacite
dat ipsa lex potestatem defendendi, quae non modo hominem occidi,
sed esse cum telo hominis occidendi caussa vetat, ut, quum caussa,
non telum quaereretur, qui sui defendendi caussa telo esset usus,
non hominis occidendi caussa habuisse telum judicaretur. Qua—
propter hoc maneat in caussa, judices; non enim dubito quin pro-
baturus sim vobis defensionem meam, si id memineritis, quod obli-
visci non potestis, insidiatorem jure interfici posse.

V. Sequitur illud, quod a Milonis inimicis saepissime dicitur,
caedem in qua P. Clodius occisus est senatum judicasse contra rem
publicam esse factam. Illam vero senatus non sententiis suis
solum, sed etiam studiis comprobavit. Quoties enim est illa caussa
a nobis acta in senatu Ξ quibus assensionibus universi ordinis,
quam nec tacitis nec occultis l Quando enim frequentissimo senatu
quattuor aut summum quinque sunt inventi qui Milonis caussam
non probarent Ξ Declarant hujus ambusti tribuni plebis illae inter-

tive law (scripta lex), for the term means
nothing else here, and such universal prin-
ciples as all mankind agree in, though they
may not be reduced to the form of positive
law. Such is the so-called law of self-
defence, univer-sally admitted, known, aud
recognized without being taught or ex-
pressed in the form of laW. Xenophon
(Mem. iv. c. 4) makes Socrates discourse
on this ‘nata lex,’ or universal rules, the
origin of which, he says, is from the gods,
as Cicero says, it is from ‘natura.'—-‘ho-
nesta ratio ι’ Halm observes that ‘honesta’
means that which can be morally justified3
and Cicero does not say ‘justa,’ as he says
below ‘interfici jure,’ because here he is
speaking of natural law (Naturrecht); of
those rules or principles which are universal,
and not merely in the positive law of any
particular country.

Sileni enim . . . repetenda] Quintilian,
v. 14. 17.—‘ Etsi . . . ipsa lex :' by observing
the connexion between these two words,
we see what he means: ‘ and yet . . . even
the1aw.‘—‘ non hominem ε’ T. E. S. Baiter;
‘non modo hominem’ C. Graevius says
that ‘ non modo' is for ‘ non modo non,' as

it often is in Cicero. Ι don’t accept that
explanation, and I retain ‘modo.' (See
remarks on ‘ non modo‚' Vol. i.)

The Lex did forbid a man to be killed,
and also to have any weapon for the pur-
pose of killing (Dig. 48. 8. 1); “Lege
Cornelia de sicariis et veneficis tenetur qui
hominem occiderit cujusque dolo malo in-
cendium factum est, quive hominis occi-
dendi furtive faciendi caussa cum telo
ambulaverit.’' But the Lex said a ‘ telum
for the purpose of killiug a man,' and
if the inquiry was for what cause one man
killed another, then if the cause was suf-
ficient, he was supposed to have had the
‘telum’ not sor the purpose of killing3
and so the Lex did not apply.

hoc maneat in caussa] Let this be
fixed, established3 this that he has just
said.

5. contra rem publicam] This was the
formula in which the senate declared that
a thing was dangerous to the State; it
might be a thing either contrary to positive
law or not.-‘ aut summumz’ T. has ‘ad
summum)
