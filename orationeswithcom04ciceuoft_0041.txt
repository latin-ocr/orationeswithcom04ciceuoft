CAR 9, 10. 19

X. Quum L. Vettium, qui in senatu confessus esset se cum telo
fuisse, mortem Gn. Pompeio summo et clarissimo civi suis manibus
offerre voluisse, in contionem produxeris, indicem in rostris, in illo,
inquam, augurato templo ac loco collocaris, quo auctoritatis exqui-
rendae caussa ceteri tribuni pl. principes civitatis producere consue-
verunt, ibi tu indicem Vettium linguam et vocem suam sceleri et
menti tuae praebere voluisti—-dixeritne L. Vettius in contione tua,
rogatus a te, sese auctores et impulsores et socios habuisse sceleris
illius eos viros, quibus e civitate sublatis, quod tu eo tempore
moliebare, civitas stare non posset? M. Bibulum, cujus inclusione
contentus non eras, interficere volueras, [spoliaras] consulatu, patria
privare cupiebas: L. Lucullum. cujus tu rebus gestiS‚ quod ipse ad
imperatorias laudes a puero videlicet spectaras, vehementius invide-
bas : G. Curionem, perpetuum hostem improborum omnium, auctorem
publici consilii, [in] libertate communi tuenda maxime liberum, cum

in contione tua] This is explained by
‘in contionem produxeris!

Madvig points the end of c. 9 and the
beginning of c. 10 thus-⁴ terreas ε fuerisne
tanta crudelitate ut delectos viros . . . roga-

10. Quum L. Vettium] See Pro Sestio,
c. 63, and the note about L. Vettius. Ma-
nutius observes that Cicero (Ad Att. ii. 24)
charges Caesar with instigating Vettius :
“ Postero die Caesar . . . Vettium in rostra

produxit, quo Bibulo consuli aspirare non tione conarere, cum L. Vettium qui ’ διο.

liceret. Hic ille omnia quae voluit de re
publica dixit ut qui illuc factus institutusque
venisset.” Here, says Manutius, Cicero
‘ temporis videlicet caussa,’ lays this to the
charge of Vatinius. But Cicero lied either
one way or the other. It is probable that
in his letter to Atticus he told the truth.
But our opinion of his veracity must be
weakened by such contradictions.

auqurato templo] The Rostra, as he tells
us.—⁴ auctoritatis exquirendae :’ before a
Lex was proposed, the tribunus pl.‚ who
was going to propose it, brought some of
the chief citizens on the Rostra to give
their opinion about the Lex, and they were
the ‘auctores' to the ‘ populus,' either to
accept or reject the Rogatio. Accordingly
Cicero said ‘auctoritatis exquirendae caussa'
(Manutius).

menti] Codd. Gulielmius proposed to
write ¹ dementiae ' for ‘ menti,’ which change
Garatoni and Madvig approve. Madvig
says that Cicero never uses ⁸ mens ' simply
for ⁶ consilium,' nor, if he had used ⁴ mens '
in this sense. would he have added such a
gentle word (tam lene) to such a weighty
word as ⁸ sceleri! Halm explains it right :
‘ sceleri et menti ¹ correspond to ‘linguam
et vocem.' Vettius was to be the tongue,
the spoken word, for the crime and the
mind or purpose of Vatinius. What could
be clearer ?

Halm in his first edition keeps the common
punctuation. In his second edition he fol-
lows Madvigv In his first edition he gives
Hermann’s reasons for keeping the common
punctuation.and says that they require no ncw
arguments to confirm them. In his second
edition he follows Madvig’s punctuation
without saying any thing more. A man
may change his mind, and ought to
change his mind, when he sees good reason
for it; but 1 doubt if Halm has improved
the text by this change in his second edition.

interficere volueras] That is ⁴ qncm inter-
ficere volueras! The word ⁶ spoliaras '
seems to Halm to be a spurious addition,
and perhaps it is. He conjectures that
some participle such as ⁴ exutum,’ ‘dejec-
tum ' has dropped out after the word ¹ con-
sulatu.'—‘L. Lucullum? he who conducted
the war against Mithridates, till hc was
superseded by Cn. Pompeius.

assassination of Pompeius (Schol.). ciem-0
