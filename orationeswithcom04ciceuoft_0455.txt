loco Deiotarum talem erga te cognovisti, qualis rex Attalus in
P. Africanum fuit, cui magnificentissima dona, ut scriptum legimus,
usque ad Numantiam misit ex Asia, quae Africanus inspectante
exercitu accepit. Quod quum praesens Deiotarus regio et animo
et more fecisset, tu in cubiculum discessisti. Obsecro, Caesar,
repete illius temporis memoriam: pone illum ante oculos diem:
vultus hominum te intuentium atque admirantium recordare. Num
quae trepidatio? num qui tumultus? num quid nisi moderate, nisi
quiete, nisi ex hominis gravissimi et sanctissimi disciplina? Quid
igitur caussae excogita-ri potest cur te lautum voluerit, caenatum
noluerit occidere? In posterum, inquit, diem distulit, ut, quum
in castellum Luceium ventum esset, ibi cogitata perficeret. Non
video caussam loci mutandi; sed tamen acta res criminose est.
Quum, inquit, vomere post caenam te velle dixisses, in balneum te
ducere coeperunt; ibi enim erant insidiae. At te eadem tua
fortuna servavit; in cubiculum te ire malle dixisti. Dii te per-
duint, fugitive ! ita non modo nequam et improbus, sed etiam fatuus

et amens es.

Attalus] Livy (Ep. 57) says that it was
Antiochus Sidetes. It may be a μνημο-
νικὸν ἁμάρτημα, such as Cicero often
committed (Pro Ligario, c. 11 , note).

lautum] Thereis also ‘lotumff Both of
them are shorter forms of ⁴ lavatum‚’ that
is ‘ lanatum! The bath came before the din·
ner, as in the heroic ages, and then the oiling.

in castellum Luceium] He has spoken
of Luceium before, and he now speaks of a
different place. There is therefore some
error here or in c. 6. Η. Sauppe conjec-
tures that we should read · Peium,’ because
Strabo (p. 567) speaks of Bluceium and
Peium, one as the royal residence and the
other as the treasury of Deiotarus.

sed tamen acca] ‘ 1 see no reason,’ says
Cicero, ⁴ for a change of place,' no reason
for attempting the assassination in another
place; ‘but still the facts furnish matter
sor a criminal charge! He is speaking
ironically‚ as Halm observes.

vomere post caenam] To get rid of his
dinner. Perhaps the king's cooking was
not good. Cicero, in the letter just referred
to (xiii. 52), speaks of this practice of
Caesar again οιι the occasion of Cicero
giving him a dinncr. On that <lay Caesar
was busy with his affairs in private till the

about public matters: ‘⁶ φιλόλογα multa.”
The great general was fond of literature.
and a learned grammarian. He was neither
8 great eater nor 8 drinker (Sueton. Caesar.
53). The critics have differed about the
meaning of *ἐμετικὴν agebat! The best
explanation is this: ⁴ he was under an eme-
tic regimen,¹ and accordingly he ate and
drank freely, intending to take the emetic
after dinner.
