DE PROVINCIIS CONSULARIBUS

ORATIO.

IN TRODUCTION .

IN the tribunate of O. Sempronius Gracchus (13.c. 123) a Lex was
enaeted, pursuant to which before the consular Comitia of each year,
the senate named two provinces which the consuls who might be elected
were to have after the expiration of their office. The provinces were
named Consulares ; and the senate could select out of all the provinces
the two which should be assigned to the future consuls. The consules
designati determined by lot which consular province each should have
(Verr. ii. 3, c. 95). In the matter of the consular provinces the Tribuni
had no power of Intercessio‚ as they formerly had (Livy, xxxii. 28). The
praetorian provinces were assigned during the year of the praetors’ office,
and in this matter, as it seems, the tribunes retained the power of In—
tercessio (De Prov. Cons. c. 7 and 15). According to this arrangement
about the consular provinces, there was an interval of about a year and a
half between the determination of the consular provinces and the time
when the consuls took possession of them, the consular comitia being
generally held about the mouth of J uly.

In B.c. 56 when the question of the consular provinces came before
the senate, Cicero was asked his opinion. At this time Gabinius had
the province of Syria and Piso had Macedonia, and their administration
had been very bad. Cicero hated both of them and with good reason,
for he says that they got their provinces not in the regular way, but
pursuant to a Lex Clodia, and as their reward for helping Clodius to
drive Cicero out of Rome. Caesar at this time (ac. 56) held the two
Galliae and was continuing his victorious career. Accordingly Cir-vtio
proposed that the provinces of Syria and Macedonia should be given to
the consuls who would be elected m that year, and that they should bo
