insulam esse venalem, cujus hic in aediculis habitat, decem, ut
opinor, millibus. Vos autem, dum illi placere vultis, ad tempus ejus

Reprehendistis a patre quod semigrarit. Quod quidem jam in
hac aetate minime reprehendendum est : qui quum et ex rei publicae
caussa jam esset mihi quidem molestam, sibi tamen gloriosam victo-
riam consecutus, et per aetatem magistratus petere posset, non modo
permittente patre, sed etiam suadente ab eo semigravit3 et quum
domus patris a foro longe abesset, quo facilius et nostras domos
obire et ipse a suis coli posset, conduxit in Palatio non magno
domum. VIII. Quo loco possum dicere id, quod vir clarissimus
M. Crassus, quum de adventu regis Ptolemaei quereretur, paullo

as sons often want to do, when they get to a
certain age. So Sulla, says Plutarch (c. 1),
in his life of Sulla, quoted by Graevius,
when he became a young man, took apart-
ments, for which he did not pay much.
Sulla, like many political adventurers who
have reached great dignity, knew what
poverty was in his youth. He lived in a
gari-et, ‘'which he was afterwards reproached
with, when he wa- prospering beyond his
deserts, as some thought ’' (Plutarch) —. ex
rei publicae caussa? the prosecution of C.
Antonius. One reason sor leaving his father's
house was that he was now old enough to
enter on political life (per aetatem magis-
tratus petere posset). Accordingly hc took
a doinus on the Palatium, at no great rent,

partos the Alexandrines some ambassadors,
a great number of whom King Ptolemaeus
contrived to get assassiriated. If Ptole-
maeus had not come, the ambassadors would
not have come, and there would have been
no complaint against Caelius of having mal-
treated these peoplc at Puteoli. Crassus,
with very little good taste, had quoted the
verse ‘Utinam 11e,’ διας Cicero goes further
in his quotation (ac longius quidem, &‹·.);
and he applies to Clodia what Euripides
says of Medea. The verses are from
Ennius' Medea, a translation and adapta—
