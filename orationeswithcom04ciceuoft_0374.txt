Cicero says that the slaves must have been

and yet he lays down the law, “De

He says afterwards of Clodius, “cujus de
morte tamquam de caerimoniis violatis
quaeritur.” Yet Clodius’ murder, if it was
The only
way of reconciling all this, is the assump-
tion that the Lex Pompeia, under which
Milo was tried, contained a provision for
the examination of his slaves, which was
irregular, but all the Lex was irregular.

servis nulla lege . . . in Clodium' seem

sage in the Orat. Partit. c. 34. But it is
plain that it is not taken from the Orat.

plainer way than this. Halm explains it in
the same way as Klotz; but he also says,
“As the atria of temples generally served
for the despatch of various affairs of busi-
ness, so it seems that this atrium was used
for manumission and other matters relating
to slaves.” If that is true, it is an explana-
tion ; but the explanation is a guess founded
on this passage, I believe.

De servis . . . in Clodium] Halm ex-
plains this to be a bitter taunt of the orator
who views the examination of Clodius’
slaves as ‘in caput domini,’ for the purpose
of proving whether Clodius was the ‘insi-
diator Milonis3’ for as Cicero views the
matter, their testimony can only be against
their masten—But this explanation hardly
fits well with the rest3 and if the passage
spoils the context, that is a good reason sor
rejecting it.
