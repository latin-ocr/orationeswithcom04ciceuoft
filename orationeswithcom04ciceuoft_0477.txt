ΤΟ ΤΗΕ PHILIPPICAE. 455

progress on the 11th of April (Ad Att. xiv. 5), and wrote to Atticus
wishing to know what it meant. He did not think that it was a matter
af any importance. Caesar passed by Puteoli, where his step-father L.
Philippus lived, and he paid a visit to Cicero who was then Philippus’
neighbour. Those who were about the youth addressed him by the
name of Caesar, but Philippus did not, nor did Cicero. The young man,
the boy, as Cicero called him—he was only eighteen-showed a very
friendly disposition to Cicero, who saw that he had understanding and
spirit, but he was afraid when he thought of his youth, the name he
bore, and of the suggestions of those who surrounded him. However
Caesar made Cicero believe that he was well-disposcd towards the
assassins, our ἥρωες, as Cicero calls them (Ad Att. xiv. 11 and 12 ; xv. 12).
Cicero does not speak of Caesar in the first two Philippics.

Caesar arrived at Rome shortly before the return of Antonius. When
the consul had come back, Caesar demanded of him the succession of the
Dictator and an account of his administration of it. Antonius refused
to come to a settlement, upon which Caesa-r sold the Dictator's land and
expended his own patrimony for the purpose of paying his great-uncle’s
legacies and giving splendid spectacles to the people. The intrigues of
Antonius were powerless against Caesar’s prudence and cantion, and at
last he found it politic to propose a reconciliation. Antonius also
gained over his colleague Dolabella, who at first had declared for the
faction of the assassins. The people had set up in the Forum a column
of Numidian stone in the form of an altar to Caesar, and with the in-
scription on it of “Parenti Patriae.'' Offerings were made there and
vows and prayers3 and the altar became a rallying point for a disorderly
rabble. About the end of April and during Antonius’ absence from
Rome (Phil. ii. c. 12) Dolabella sent a strong force to clear the place.
The people made resistance, but some of them were cut down, and
others were seized ; the slaves were crucified; the freemen were pitched
down the Tarpeian rock. The altar was taken away and the place was
paved. Cicero was delighted with Dolabella’s proceedings. He hoped
to find in him a resolute opponent to Antonius <Ad Att. xiv. 15 and 20),
a man to his own mind, and a worthy disciple. He wrote to Dolabella
(Ad Att. xiv. 17 A, and Ad Div. ix. 14) a long letter of congratulation‚
in most extravagant languagc, one of the many proofs of his strong
adhesion to the party of Brutus and Cassius and of his sanguine hopes
of the future, which were always disappointcd. Antonius soon changed
Dolabella’s policy. The man was in debt and wished to retain the
province of Syria, which he had already obtained from the people. An-
tonius bought Dolabella, and Cicero changed his opinions about his son-
in-law (Ad Att. xiv. 18 ; xvi. 15).

In the arrangements which Caesar had made about the provinces, M.
