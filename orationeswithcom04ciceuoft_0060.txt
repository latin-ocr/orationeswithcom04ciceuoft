38 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO.

suscepta inter cives non contra rem publicam ;’ and cc. 6, 11).”

(Waechtcr.)

In the J uliae Leges de vi wc have a distinction between Vis Publica
and Vis Privata, for there were two J uliae Leges on this subject, re-
spcctively entitled Dc Vi Publica, and De Vi Privata (Dig. 48, tit. 6 and
7). But we have no evidence in the notices of the Lex Plautia that it
made a distinction between Vis Publica and Vis Privata3 and accord-
ingly we assume that it did not, until the contrary can be proved.

We do not know what the penalty of the Lex Plautia was. It is⁵
generally assumed that it was ‘ aquae et ignis interdictio ’ (Introduction
to the oration Pro Sulla, Vol. iii). Waechter says: “ Even if examples
should be found of many persons going into exilium on the occasion of
an Accusatio de vi, and of the Interdictio aquae et ignis being after-
wards passed against them, this would not prove that according to the
Lex Plautia the regular penalty against a man who stood his trial and
was convicted, was exilium.” But if this was not the penalty, he asks
what could it be, for Relegatio was not made a punishment until the
imperial period. Nothing remains, he says, except a pecuniary penalty
and deprivation of the capacity to obtain the honores, to sit in the senate
and thelike. This is the punishment which was fixed by the Lex J ulia
de vi privata3 and as this Lex provided for the offences which were com-
prised in the Lex Plautia, we may conclude that it also adopted the
penalties of that Lex.

The reader who wishes to investigate this matter further, may consult
Rein (Das Criminalrecht, Soc. p. 738) and the writers whom he quotes,
if it should be worth his while. Rein concludes that there must have
been a Lex Lutatia de vi; and this we must admit, for Cicero says so.
But we do not know any thing more about it, and all conjecture is use-
less. Rein reconciles Cicero’s statement that the smaller conspirators
were punished under the Lex Lutatia, though elsewhere it is said that
they were prosecuted under the Lex Plautia, by a pure assumption that
the Lutatia merely regulated the procedure. With respect to the
penalty of the Lex Plautia, which he conjectures to have been banish-
ment, he refers to the Pro Sulla (c. 31) and to the Pro Sestio (c. 69),
which passages-seem to confirm his opinion. .
