650 ORAT. PHILIPPIOARUM LIBER UNDEOIMUS.

bosve, ni Brutum colligassemus in Graecia, et ejus auxilium ad
Italiam vergere quam ad Asiam maluissemus; non ut ex ea acic
respectum haberemus, sed ut ipsa acies subsidium haberet etiam
transmarinum. Praeterea, patres conscripti, M. Brutum retinet
etiam nunc C. Antonius, qui tenet Apolloniam, magnam urbem et
gravem, tenet, opinor, Byllidem, tenet Amantiam, instat Epiro,
urget Oricum, habet aliquot cohortes, habet equitatum. Hinc si
Brutus erit traductus ad aliud bellum, Graeciam certe amiserimus.
Est autem etiam de Brundisio atque illa ora Italiae providendum.
Quamquam miror tamdiu morari Antonium 3 solet enim ipse acci-
pere manicas nec diutius obsidionis metum sustinere. Quod si con-
fecerit Brutus et intellexerit plus se rei publicae profuturum, si
Dolabellam persequatur quam si in Graecia maneat, aget ipse per
sese, ut adhuc quoque fecit, neque in tot incendiis, quibus con-
festim succurrendum est, exspectabit senatum. Nam et Brutus et
Cassius multis jam in rebus ipse sibi senatus fuit. Necesse est
enim in tanta conversione et perturbatione omnium rerum tempori-
bus potius parere quam moribus. Nec enim nunc primum aut
Brutus aut Cassius salutem libertatemque patriae legem sanctissi-
mam et morem optimum Judicavit. Itaque si ad nos nihil referre-
tur de Dolabella persequendo, tamen ego pro decreto putarem,
quum essent tales virtute, auctoritate, nobilitate summi viri, quo-

both places. Cicero says (Phil. x. c. 4>:
“Quod qui ab illo abducit exercitum, et
respectum pulcherrimum et praesidium fir-
missimum adimit rei publicae.’' Various at-
tempts have been made to explain this pas-
sage (c. ll), but none that Ι have seen are
successful. It is one of those passages
where the words may be translated, but
there is no sense in them ; and we may con-
clude that there is something corrupt.
Oricum] ‘ mei ' says Halm. “ Illyricum,
liber unus atque alter: in queis Gad. quod
probo '⁷ (Ferrarius); who observes that Ci-
cero had said in the Tenth Philippic, that
C. Antonius had attempted to seize Illy·
ricum 3 and he adds that ⁴ Illyricum ’ would
be properly mentioned after Epirus, but
Oricus would not, for a province (Epirus)
would be confounded among towns. If
C. Antonius held Apollonia, which is north
of the river Αοιις, he was on the borders of
Epirus, and the next thing would be to
make an attempt on Oricus, which is south
of the Aous. If the river Drilo was the
southern boundary of Illyricum, thc mention
of Illyricum is out of place here, for Anto-
nius was threatening Epirus, and therefore
Oricus is more appropriately mentioned

here than Illyricum. But the real southern
boundary of Illyricum is a difficulty. Pto-
lemy (iii. 14, §2) places oricus in that
part of the Epirus which he calls Chaonia.
Amantia was also south of the Aous. Ci-
cero has not kept to any strict propriety in
enumerating these places.

habet aliquot cohortes] ‘⁶ Septem, ut
opinor” (Manutius), Phil. x. 6.—-‘morari
Antonium:y C. Antonius. Cicero expresses
his wonder that C. Antonius lingers so long
and does not cross over to Brundisium3
for ‘he is accustomed himself to take the
sleeves,’ which is explained ‘ to put on his
manicae or arm coverings,' and to move
on, or to get out of his enemy’s way, and
not to stand the danger of a siege.

Quod si confecerit] Lambinus suggested
that ⁴ bellum ’ should be added after ⁴ confe-
cerit.⁷ Halm suggests ‘ Quem si confecerit.’

summi viri] Faernus says that either
‘ summi ’ is superfluous, which however
he does not believe, or we must read ‘ sum-
ma,’ or for ⁴ tales ' we must read ‘ tali‚' or
finally, that there is some other fault.
Halm ingeniously suggests that ‘ sum-
miuiri' is a corruption of ‘cum imperio ’
(imp). The words ‘ quum essent' &a
