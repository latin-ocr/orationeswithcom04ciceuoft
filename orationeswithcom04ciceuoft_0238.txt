people so long as they were free, never wanted the law, but they called
for it when they were oppressed by the domination and power of the
great (principes). There were four Leges tabellariae, the first of which,
the Gabinia, related to the clection of magistrates, a Lex, says Quintus
in Cicero’s Dialogue, proposed by an unknown and mean person. The
other Leges tabellariae were enacted after the Gabinia, and esta-
blished the ballot in certain public trials and in legislation (Carbonis
tertia de jubendis legibus ac vetandis). The Lex Maria, says Cicero,
made the ‘pontes’ narrow (pontes etiam lex Maria fecit angustos).
The ‘ pontes ’ are the passages or approaches by which the voting-place*
was reached, and as we know nothing more of this Lex than what has
been stated, we may assume that 'the purpose of it was to prevent con-
fusion and crowding at the polling-place, and any interference with the
voter. One purpose might be to enable him to deposit his voting-
tablet quietly in its place, and to prevent any busy meddler from seeing
how he voted.

A Lex Fabia is mentioned by Cicero (Pro Murena, c. 34, Vol. iii),
but it seems that it was not carried (legi Fabiae, quae est de numero
sectatorum, ἂψ).

In Ro. 67 the tribune C. Cornelius proposed a Lex on Ambitus, but
the Senate thought it was too severe, and they empowered the consuls
Μ’. Acilius Glabrio and C. Calpurnius Piso to propose a new Lex, which
was the Acilia Calpurnia. This Lex is described as most strict
(ι severissime scripta,’ Cicero Pro Mur. c. 23) 3 but the people did not
like it so well as the proposed Lex of C. Cornelius. The enactment of
the Lex Acilia Calpurnia was forcibly resisted by the ‘divisores,' and
the consul Piso was obliged to protect himself by a superior force in
order to carry his Lex (Ascon. In Corn. p. 75, ed. Orelli). The penal-
ties imposed by this Lex on those who secured their election by
bribery were a pecuniary fine and perpetual incapacity to attain any of
the ‘ honores ' or high offices of the state 3 but they were allowed to live at
Rome. (Dion Cassius xxxvi. 21—233 Schol. Bob. Cic. p, 361, Orelli.)

In B.o. 63, the consul M. Tullius Cicero proposed and carried the
Lex Tullia de Ambitu. He was supported in carrying the preliminary
Senatusconsultum by Servius Sulpicius, who wished to establish the
‘confusio suffragiorum’ as a means of preventing bribery. (Pro Mu-
rena, c. 23, Vol. iii. and the note.) Servius proposed that the votes
should not be given by Tribus or Centuriae in the usual way, but that
amajority of all the votes should decide. This measure would have
helped very much to check bribery, for as each centuria had a vote,
which vote was determined by a majority in the centuria, it was much
easier to secure a, majority by bribery and other ways in a small number
of electors than to deal with the whole body of electors The Lex
