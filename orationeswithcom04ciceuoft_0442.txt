ORAT. PRO Q. LIGARIO OAP. 12.

possis, nec natura [tua] melius quam ut velis servare quam plurimos.
Longiorem orationem caussa forsitan postulat, tua certe natura
breviorem. Quare quum utilius esse arbitrer te ipsum quam me aut
quemquam loqui tecum, finem jam faciam: tantum te admonebo, si
illi absenti salutem dederis, praesentibus his omnibus [te] daturum.

jective ‘salma’ He means by ‘helping
men,' ‘doing them good.' The critics
quote a similar expression from Strabo
(lib. x. p. 467) and other writers.

Nilzz'l habet . . . plurimos] Quintilian
(viii. 5. 7), who has ‘⁴ Nihil habet, Caesar,
nec‚'' διο.

forsitan postulat]
has altered this to ‘fortasse postulabat!
He says that there is no sure passage in

Cicero which shows that ‘forsitan’ can be
used with the indicative3 and he says that
¹ postulat' might do at the beginning of a
speech, but never at the end. Baiter rel
marks (1856) that Halm suspects that we
should read ‘forsitan postulavit' or ‘for-
tasse postulat‚' and so he seems to have

Halm in his edition changed his mind about ‘ postulat-²

[te] daturum] Baiter omits ‘te.’
