214 PRO GN. PLANCIO.

that this speech was delivered either in the latter part of August or the
beginning of September Ro. 54, while O. Caesar and Cicero’s brother
Quintus were in Britain.

The aediles for the year B.c. 54 ought to have been elected in Rc.
553 but we might affirm that they were not elected in Rc. 55, if wc
had no other evidence than the fact of this speech being delivered in
Rc. 543 for if Plancius had been elected in Rc. 55, he would have been
prosecuted while he was Aedilis designatus.

It appears from this oration (c. 22) that a consul, M. Licinius Crassus,
as we may assume, attempted to hold the comitia in Rc. 55 for the
election of aediles for the following year. We do not know what pre-
vented the elections of Rc. 55 from being held in due form, but it is cer-
tain that Cn. Plancius and A. Plotius were not elected aediles curules until
B.c. 54. As Plancius was prosecuted in August or September, we may
assume that his election had just taken place, and that he had not entered
on his office. A letter of Cicero to his brother Quintus (ii. 15), written
in June, shows that the comitia had not yet been held: Cicero says
there is some hope that they will be held. The prosecutor was M. J uven-
tius Laterensis, who had lost his election when Plancius was elected.

Cicero has two orations in defence of his friends who were prosecuted
for bribery at elections (ambitus), L. Murena (Vol. iii. p. 89) and Cn.
Plancius. A Lex passed in B.0. 55, the Lex Licinia de Sodaliciis, con-
tained some new provisions about the law of bribery at elections, and it
is necessary for the reader to know what these provisions are, and
generally to know the history of the Roman laws against bribery, before
he can understand this oration.

The history of bribery at Rome is instructive for those modern
nations in which bribery is practised. The elections came on yearly,
and thus the Romans had plenty of opportunity for becoming sharp in
election practice. It was the fashion to solicit votes, to go about (amb-
ire) to ask the voters, to shake hands, say civil things, and the like.
This was the original ⁴ ambitio,' not quite so mischievous as the modern
Anibition. An early attempt was made to check this mean practice of
going about to beg. The tribunes in Rc. 432 proposed and carried a
Lex which forbade a man to “add any white to his dress for electioneer-
ing purposes ’' (Livy iv. 25). He was not allowed to make himself
conspicuous by his dress, to be ‘ candidatus.' This small matter made a
great disturbance at the time, the Patricians being much opposed to the
Lex, for they were the canvassers for votes, and they both solicited and
threatened the voter.

A Lex Poetelia (Liv. vii. 16) was directed chiefly against the canvass-
ing by ‘ novi homines,’ by men whose ancestors had never filled the
higher offices in the state. These rnen were perhaps more active can-
