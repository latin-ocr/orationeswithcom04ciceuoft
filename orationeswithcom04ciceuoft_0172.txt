150 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

tate hominis potentissimi in maximis nostris malis atque discordiis
neminem umquam alterius rationis ac partia non re, non verbo, non
vultu denique offendit. Fuit hoc sive meum sive rei publicae fatum,
ut in me unum omnis illa inclinatio communium temporum incum-
beret. Non modo non exsultavit in ruinis vestris nostrisque dis-
cordiis Cornelius, sed omni officio, lacrimis, opera, consolatione
omnes me absente meos sublevavit. Quorum ego testimonio
ac precibus munus hoc meritum huic, et, ut a principio dixi,justam«
et debitam gratiam refero„ speroque, judices, ut 605, qui principes
fuerunt conservandae salutis aut dignitatis meae, diligitis et 'caros
habetis, sic, quae ab hoc pro facultate hujus, pro loco facta sunt, et
grata esse vobis et probata. Non igitur a suis, quos nullos habet,
sed a suorum, qui et multi et potentes sunt, urgetur inimicis; quos
quidem hesterno die Gn. Pompeius copiosa oratione et gravi secum,
si vellent, contendere jubebat, ab hoc impari certamine atque injusta
contentione avocabat. XXVII. Et erat aequa lex et nobis,
judices, atque omnibus qui nostris familiaritatibusimplicantur vehe—
menter utilis, ut nostras inimicitias ipsi inter nos geramus, amicis
nostrorum inimicorum temperemus. Ac si mea auctoritas satis
apud illos in hac re ponderis liaberet, quum me praesertim rerum
varietate atque usu ipso iam perdoctum viderent, etiam ab illis eos
majoribus discordiis avocarem. Et enim contendere de re publica
quum id defendas quod esse optimum sentias, et fortium virorum et
magnorum hominum semper putavi, neque huic umquam labori,
officio, muneri defui. Sed contentio tamdiu sapiens est quamdiu

27. majoribus discordiis] Pompeius
had invited 1115 6116111165 to try their strength
on him and not 011 others, whom they hoped
to oppress (e. 26. at the end). Cicero says

riors, for which he might have interested

motives ; but he did not insult any man in

his misfortunes‚ and that is some merit.
hominis potentissimi] C. Caesar, with

whom he was very intimate at the time of
Cicero’s great troubles, when he was driven
from Rome (13.6. 58).

illa inclinatio] It is a metaphor from
something which falls and covers us with
its ruins. The passage cannot be translated,
but it may be explained: ‘All the weight
of the evils which threatened the state fell
on Cicero.'—‘ lacrimis :' a word which
seems out of place, though with Cicero
tears were always 111 place. He shed tears
himself whenever he chose, and he might
expect them from others when the occasion
came. Madvig proposes to omit ‘ lacrimis,’
and to write in the preceding line, ‘in
ruinis nostris lacrimisque) Some editions
have ‘in ruinis nostris vestrisque discordiis.'

pro loco] ‘Pro suo statu, suaque con-
ditione' (Manutius).

that this is a good rule3 and he adds, ‘ we
should settle our own quarrels among our-
selves‚ and make the hostility of our ene-
mies light to our friends.' He then says
that if they would take his advice, he would
draw them away also from those more
serious disputes3 from those attempts to
check what they cannot check3 in a word,
the power of Caesar and his faction. For
this is what he comes to shortly after, when
he says that they had resisted Caesar's
power in vain, and that he had set the wise
example of yielding when resistance was
useless; he had even proposed the extra-
ordinary honours which had lately been 6011-
feri-ed on Caesar. He was all submission
to the great man, who was Balbus’ friend
and patron, and would not be pleased if
they pronounced an unfavourable verdict.
