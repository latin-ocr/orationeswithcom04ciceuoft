136 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

esse nihil potest nisi quod populus plebesve sanxisset: deinde sanc-
tiones sacrandae sunt aut genere ipso aut obtestatione et consecra-
tione legis aut poenae, quum caput ejus qui contra, fecerit conse—
cratur. Quid habes igitur dicere de Gaditano foedere ejusmodi?
Utrum a capitis consecratione an obtestatione legis sacrosanctum
esse confirmas? Nihil omnino umquam de isto foedere ad populum,
nihil ad plebem latum esse dico. De quibus [igitur] etiamsi latum
esset [neque legem neque poenam gratam esse,] ne quem civem
reciperemus, tamen id esset quod postea populus jussisset ratum,
neque quidquam illis verbis, Si quid sacrosanctum esset, esse ex-
ceptum videretur, de iis, quum populus Romanus nihil umquam jus-
serit, quidquam audes dicere sacrosanctum fuisse? XV. Nec vero
haec oratio inea ad infirmandum foedus Gaditanorum, judices, per- ’
tinet. Neque enim est meum contra opinionem vetustatis, contra jus

he explains it. ‘ Sanctiones sacrandae

mitted that any thing was excepted by vir-
sunt aut genere ipso ' means, he says, ‘the

tue of those words, ‘ If any thing had been

sanctiones which consist in the penalty of a
curse exist either in and by themselves 3⁷
that is, stand in no relation to any thing
else, but contain their own determination
in themselves. The words ‘aut obtesta-
tione et consecratione legis aut poenae‚' he

interprets, ⁴ or they consist in the hallowing ’

which is effected by calling on the gods and
the penal curse of a legal rule or of a
penalty, so far as the head of him, who
shall'act in violation of all this, is devoted
to the infernal gods! He has some further
remarks· on this sentence3 but this is suffi-
cient to explain the way in which he views
it.

The following words ‘ a capitis . . . legis ’
refer, as he correctly remarks, to the special
foedus of the Gaditani, and accordingly
Cicero has no occasion to use such words as
⁸ genere ips0.’ He comes to particulars,

Utrum a capitis] ‘utrum capitis ’ Ant.
Augustinus, Baiter.—[‘ neque legem . . .
gratam esse ’] : these words are corrupt, at.
least the word ‘ gratam 3’ and if we put
⁴ ratam ’ in place of ‘ gratam) as Klotz sug-
gests, or any other word, the whole clause
is superfluous and ill placed. The meaning
of the sentence without these words is clear,
but it is very difficult to translate. Cicero
says ε “ 1 affirm that no legislatiye proposi-
tion about that foedus of the Gaditani was
ever made to the populus or the plebS.”
He adds : ¹‘ Even if there had been an enact-
ment that we should not receive any citizen
of some particular state, still a subsequent
expression of the will os the populus would
have its full effect, and it would not be ad-

ratified under the penalty of a curse :⁷ and
when we are speaking of a people, with
respect to whom the populus has never ex-
pressed its will, do you venture to say that
in such a case any thing is ratified under
the penalty of a curse ?'' This is the
meaning3 nor can it be expressed in fewer
words. It is necessary to keep the order of
the ideas in the sentence, that the opposition
between ⁴ de quibus ' and ⁴ de iis ’ may be
maintained. But a good translation of this
sentence is almost impossible. It. is a use-
ful example of the power of the Latin lan-
guage, and of the small flexibility which it
has for the purpose of translation.

15. haee oratio] P. and Baiter omit
‘ haec· — ‘ duo fulmina :’ Vix-gil (Aeneid.
vi. 843):

“ et geminos duo fulmina belli
Scipiadas.’'

In Vat. c. ll he has ‘ lumina civitatis! Lu-
cret. iii. 1034, “ Scipiadas, belli fulmen.''

The two Scipiones lost their lives in Spain
in the second Punic war (Livy, 25, c. 37).
Livy calls Ιι. Marcius an ‘ eques.’ I sup-
pose he might be both an eques and a cen-
turion of the fir=t rank (primi pili). The
Romans had various expressions They said
¹ primum pilum ducere ' (Caesar, B. G. v.
35); also they said ‘primipilus' (Caesar,
Β. G. ii. 25). Caesar also says ‘ primi pili
centurio ' (B. G. iii. 5). The ‘primi pili
centurio ' is the first in rank of the sixty
centurions in a legion. Lucan (i. v. 356)
says “ summi tune munera pili.’'
