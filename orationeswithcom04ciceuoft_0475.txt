TO THE PHILIPPICAE. 453

23—33) has made a speech for him. The senate resolved that there
should be no further inquiry about Caesar’s death, and that all his mea-
sures (acta) should be confirmed. The veteran soldiers were kept quiet
by a promise that their grants of lands should not be disturbed. M.
Brutus and Cassius, even before the resolution of the senate was made,
spokc to the soldiers from their safe place in the Capitol, and promised
them security for their grants. Brutus afterwards wrote out this speech,
or made a new one, and sent it to his friend Cicero for correction before
it was published. Cicero found it above all correction 3 nothing could be
more elegant, he tells Atticus (xv. 1, B); and he wants his friend’s
opinion about it. At this unsettled time Brutus was busy about turning
phrases, and Cicero had leisure to admire.

The consuls summoned the people to hear the resolution of the senate,
and Cicero made them a speech in praise of the amnesty. On the lSth
of March the Liberators, as some called them, the murderers (parri-
cidae), as others named them, came down from the Capitol and appeared
in the senate. A reconciliation of all parties seemed to be accomplished3
but Antonius soon put an end to it.

On the 17th of March the senate had decreed a public funeral for
Caesar’s body, and declared that his will should be opened and read
(Appiam, B. C. ii. 136). The testament declared C. Octavius, the grand-
son of the Dictator’s younger sister, his heir, and that he should take
Caesar's name. It gave to the people for their use Caesar’s gardens
beyond the Tiber, and to every Roman citizen a legacy of 300 Qtertii.
Among the ‘secundi heredes,' or those who should take the property
in case the primary dispositions of the testament failed, was D. Brutus,
one of the assassins.

The seelings of the people were stirred up by the generosity of the
Dictator and the ingratitude of his assassins3 and Antonius took advan-
tage of this disposition. He made a funeral oration over the Dictator
in the Forum, and displayed the blood-staiued dress and mutilated body.
The people, instead of allowing the body to be taken to the Campus
Martius, made a pile of such combustible materials as were ready to
hand, and burnt the body in the Forum. The conflagration spread to
the house of L. Bellienus, a senator, and was only stopped by the exer-
tions of the soldiers. The crowd ran with brands to set fire to the
houses of the chief conspirators, and particularly those of M. Brutus aud
Cassius, but they were repulsed. Part of the conspirators hid them-
selves, and some retired from the city. The story of these disturbances
is told with some variations by the extant authorities, but the main facts
are the same in all.

The senate was irritated against Antonius for what he had donc iu tho
matter of Caesar’s funeral. It was his intention to ronse the peoplc and
