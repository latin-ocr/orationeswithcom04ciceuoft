502 ORAT. PHILIPPICARUM LIBER SECUNDUS.

consulares, qui per valetudinem exsequi cladem illam fugamque
potuissent, praetores, praetorios, tribunos plebis, magnam partem
senatus, omnem sobolem juventutis, unoque verbo rem publicam
expulsam atque exterminatam suis sedibus. Ut igitur in seminibus
est caussa arborum et stirpium, sic hujus luctuosissimi belli semen
tu fuisti. Doletis tres exercitus populi Romani interfectos: inter-
fecit Antonius. Desideratis clarissimos cives: eos quoque nobis
eripuit Antonius. Auctoritas hujus ordinis afflicta est: afflixit
Antonius. Omnia denique, quae postea vidimus, quid autem mali
non vidimus? si recte ratiocinabimur, uni accepta referemus An-
tonio. Ut Helena Trojanis, sic iste huic rei publicae belli caussa,
caussa pestis atque exitii fuit. Reliquae partes tribunatus prin-
cipio similes. Omnia perfecit, quae senatus salva re publica ne
fieri possent perfecerat. Cujus tamen scelus in scelere cognoscite.
XXIII. Restituebat multos calamitosos. In his patrui nulla
mentio. Si severus, cur non in omnes? Si misericors cur non in
suos? Sed omitto ceteros. Licinium Denticulam de alea condem-
natum, collusorem suum, restituit, quasi vero ludere cum condem-
nato non liceret; sed ut, quod in alea perdiderat, beneficio legis
dissolveret. Quam attulisti rationem populo Romano cur eum
restit-ui oporteret? Absentem, credo, in reos relatum, rem indicta
caussa judicatam, nullum fuisse de alea lege judicium, vi oppressum
et armis; postremo, quod de patruo tuo dicebatur, pecunia judi-

eoepulsam] The seat of government was
removed to Capua, and then to Thessa-
lonica (Halm).—‘ut igitur in seminibus:’
F. Ursini remarks that this is an imitation
of Demosthenes, De Corona, c, 52 : ὁ γὰρ
τὸ σπέρμα παρασχὼν, οὗτος τῶν φύντων
κακῶν αἰ’τιος.-ί tres exercitus ε’ see e. 30.

Halm.—⁴ cujus tamen scelus ι’ ‘ and yet hear
what villainy he committed in his villainy.'
He did villainous acts by recalling exiles, and
yet 116 committed another vile act by not
recalling his uncle, C. Antonius (c. 33),
among them.

V b t. Dion Cassius (45, c. 47) calls him
Lenticulus, and says that he was banished
for his dissolute life. The Romans had an
enactment against games of chance (lex
aleatoria) ; the penalty was ‘ in quadru-
plum‚' and the consequence of conviction
was Infamia, as some say. When Cicero
says ‘ restituit,' he can only mean that An-
tonius ‘restituit in integrum‚' as he says
afterwards, he restored Denticula to his for-
mer condition, he removed the penalty that

he was under ; and it cannot mean that 116
was in exile, because he says ‘ quasi vero . . .
non liceret.’ Halm remarks that Dion,
when he says τὸν Λεντίκουλον τὸν ἐπὶ τῇ
τοῦ βίου ῥᾳδιουργίᾳ φυγόντα ἐπανήγαγε,
has misunderstood this passage of Cicero.
This passage of Dion occurs in a long
speech (45, c. 13—47)‚ which he puts in
Cicero's mouth. The speech, as Halm ob-
serves, is patched up out of Cicero’s Philip-
picae, principally out of the second Philip-
pic. Rein (Das Criminalrecht der Romer,
p. 833) says that Denticula was exiled, not
for gaming, but for ρᾳδιουργὶα, as Dion
says, for false play, perhaps for using false
dice.

beneficio] Antonius, he means, received
money from Denticula for getting the Lex
passed for his ‘restitutio in integrum!—
‘absentem,' 8ιο- : these would be reasons for
rescinding the judgment. He speaks of
his uncle Antonius' condemnation being
said to have been accomplished through
bribery3 and this would have been a good
ground for rescinding the judgment against
him, and yet M. Antonius had not done it.
