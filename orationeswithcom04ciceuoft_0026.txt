M. TULLII CICERONIS

IN

P. VATINIUM TESTEM ORArio.

I. Si tua tantummodo, Vatini, quid indignitas postularet
spectare voluissem, fecissem id, quod his vehementer placebat, ut
te, cujus testimonium propter turpitudinem vitae sordesque domes-
ticas nullius momenti putaretur, tacitus dimitterem. Nemo enim
horum aut ita te refutandum ut gravem adversarium, aut ita
rogandum ut religiosum testem arbitrabatur. Sed fui paullo ante
intemperantior fortasse quam debui. Odio enim tui, in quo etsi
omnes propter tuum in me scelus superare debeo, tamen ab omnibus
paene vincor, sic sum incitatus ut, quum te non minus contemnerem
quam odissem, tamen vexatum potius quam despectum vellem
dimittere. Qum-Q ne tibi hunc honorem a me haberi forte
mirere quod interrogem, quem nemo congressu, nemo aditu, nemo

l. Si tua] ‘ Si’ P. ‘Si tua‚' codd. not seem necessary, nor perhaps is it possi-

rell. et edd. (Halm); who writes ⁴ tan-
tummodo tua‚⁷ because he thinks that
‘ tua ' is in the wrong place.-‘ indignitas:'
⁸ worthlessness.' He says afterwards “ne
tibi hune honorem a me haberi forte mirerel'
-‘ his ι’ Sextius and his ⁴ patroni ' and
‘ advocati ' as Goveanus supposes3 and this
seems to be the true explanation. Manu-
tius refers ⁴ his’ to the ‘judices.’ The mean-
ing of ‘ hi ' in such cases will depend on the
context. See c. 3.—-‘aut rogandum ι’ P.
Halm.

sordes domesticas] Manutius supposes
this to mean his poverty‚ but Cicero speaks
(c. 12) of the wealth of Vatinius. Abi-ami
thinks that the orator means Vatinius’ filthy
practices at home3 and Goveanus supposes
that it refers to the meanness of his condi-
tion, as in c. 5, “ obscuritate et sordibus
tuis.'' As the word signifies ‘dirtss it does

ble, to ascertain exactly what Cicero meant.
Horace uses ‘ sordes ' and ⁴ sordidus ' in
various senses.

ante intemperantior] ‘ante intempera-
tior‚' P. G. Halm, who however thinks that
‘intemperantior ' is the true form. The
critics do not agree about the time signified
by ¹ paullo ante! lt may be, as Halm sup-
poses, the time when he deelared that he
would question Vatinius.—‘ tuum in me
scelus:’ he combined wit-h P. Clodius against
Cicero (c. 17).

hunc honorem . . quod] Hermann ob-
serves that the meaning is, ‘that you may not
wonder that this my questioning you—⁴ tam-
quam honorem tibi haberi.' '⁷ But there is
no ‘tanquam ' in the original. Hermann
means that ⁴ hunc ’ is api-edicate equivalent
to ⁴ hoc‚’ and so it might be, if Cicero had
said ⁸ putes’ in place of ‘ mirere 3' and he
