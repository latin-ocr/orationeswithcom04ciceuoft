CAP. 34, 35. 203

barbarorum sanctissimumque direptum est. Tua scelera dii im-
mortales in nostros milites expiaverunt; qui quum uno genere
morbi affligerentur, neque se recreare quisquam posset qui semel
incidisset, dubitabat nemo quin violati hospites, legati necati,
pacati atque socii nefario bello lacessiti, fana vexata hanc tantam
efficerent vastitatem. Cognoscis ex particula parva scelerum et
crudelitatis tuae genus universum.

Quid avaritiae, quae criminibus infinitis implicata est, summam
nunc explicem? Generatim ea quae maxime nota sunt dicam.
Nonne sestertium centies et octogies, quod quasi vasarii nomine in
venditione mei capitis ascripseras‚ ex aerario tibi attributum Romae
in quaestu reliquisti? Nonne, quum c talenta tibi Apolloniatae
Romae dedissent, ne pecunias creditas solverent, ultro Fufidium,
equitem Romanum, hominem ornatissimum, creditorem debitoribus
suis addixisti? Nonne, hiberna quum legato praefectoque tuo tra-
didisses, evertisti miseras funditus civitates, quae non solum bonis
sunt exhaustae, sed etiam nefarias libidinum contumelias turpitudi-
nesque subierunt? Qui modus tibi fuit frumenti aestimandi? qni
honorarii? si qpidem potest vi et metu extortum honorarium nomi-
nari. Quod quum peraeque omnes, tum acerbissime Boeotii, et
Byzantii, Cherronenses, Thessalonica sensit. Unus tu dominus.

Quid avaritiae] This is a text for Abrami,
who says that greediness is the root of all
evil. So says Aristotle ; ambition and greedi-
ness are the cause of nearly all the bad acts
that man does. This is what Cicero tells
us; a man does not wrong his neighbour
except to gain something by it (Pro Sex.
Rosc. Am. c. 30). It is nearly the whole
of the matter-3 but not quite all. Piso was
greedy, and he stopped at no crime to satisfy
his passion, Abrami quotes from Diogenes
Laertius a saying of the Cynic Diogenes:
τὴν φιλαργυρίαν εἷπε μητρόπολιν πάντων
των κακων.

centies et octoqies] An enm-mous snm,
which he received ⁴ vasarii nomine,' on the
account of outfit. Manutius has quite mis-
understood the term ‘ vasarium.¹ Cicero
(c. 2 of this oration) speaks of a ‘⁴ provincia
exercitu et pecunia instructa et ornata.''
Compare Verr. ii. 4, c. 5, and the note.
Cicero charges Piso with getting a large sum
as outtit, and leaving it at Rome to be em-
ployed for his advantage.-·attributum :’
this neuter refers to ‘sestertium centies,’
and it is according to usage.

c talenta] Some MSS. have cc. Halm
thinks that c is enough. The Apolloniatae,
the people of Apollonia on the coast of the

Hadriatic, paid Piso in order that he might.
save them from paying their debt to Fufidius.
one of the Roman negotiatores. The pro-
vincial towns often horrowed money of the
Roman negotiatores at most extravagant
interest, and as they could not directly re-
pudiate their debt, as some of the North
American §tates have done, they managed
to get rid of their obligations, as the orator
says, by bribing the governor. When
Cicero says ‘creditorem debitoribus suis
addixisti‚' he is speaking ‘oratorie,’ falsely,
for the thing was impossible. He only means
to say that he did not allow the creditor to
get his debt.

⁸frumenti aestimandi] This matter is ex-
plained in the notes to the Verrine orations
(vol. i. Iudex).

¹ Honorarium frumentum ' is not men-
tioned in the Veri-ine orations, but a pas-
sage in one of Cato's speeches (Isid. Orig.
l. 20, 3, 8. quoted by Mayer, Orat. Rom.
Tr.) explains it ι “ Cum essem in provincia
legatus. quamplures nd praetores et con-
sules vinum honorarium dabant : numquam
accepi. nec privatus quidem.'' l’resents of
corn, wine, and other things were made to
the Roman governorS.

Cherronerweae] C. Halm writes ‘ Chorso-
