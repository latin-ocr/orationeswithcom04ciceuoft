INTRODUOTION. 695

The Praetorii of Caesar were entirely destroyed, The Martii under
Carsuleius defeated the legion which was opposed to them3 and those
under Pansa held out bravely till Pansa was wounded and carried out of
the fight to Bononia. His men at first fell back slowly, but their retreat
soon became a flight. The Tirones upon this flew in confusion to the
entrenched camp, which the Quaestor Torquatus had formed during the
battle. The Martii halted outside of the entrenchments, and though
exhausted shewed that they were still ready to renew the fight. Anto-
nius let them alone, knowing that they were dangerous enemies3 but
he sell on the Tirones, and killed a great number of them.

Hirtius, who was before Mutina, hearing of the battle, which had
been fought sixty stadia or seven miles and a half distant (at Forum
Gallorum), hurried to the spot with the other legion which had revolted
from Antonius. It was now late in the eveniug, and Antonius’ men
were returning full of joy for their victory. Hirtius fell on them unex-
pectedly‚ when they were in disorder, with a complete, fresh legion.
They made however a stout resistance, but were beaten, and a great
many of them were killed. Hirtius did not pursue the enemy, for sear
of being entangled in the marshes, Antonius spent the night in a small
place near the battle ground. The name of the place was Forum Gal-
lorum, now Castel Franco. About half the men fell on each side, except
the Praetorii of Caesar, who were entirely destroyed, and except the few
whom Hirtius lost. It is said in a letter from Pollio to Cicero (Ad
Div. x. 33) that D. Carfulenus was killed. This is the man mentioned
in Phil. iii. c. 9, aud the same whom Appian names Carsuleius.

The story of these fights is told shortly by Dion Cassius (426, c. 37).

The battle was fought on the 15th of April, according to the date in “

Galba's letter. The battle before Mutina in which Hirtius was killed
and Antonius was defeated, was fought after the delivcry of this oration,
the last of Cicero's extant Philippicae.

It is not likely that Cicero discontinued his efforts in the senate after
he had delivered this speech, and there is some evidence that there were
other Philippicae (p. 458). Howcoer, we have now nothing more by
him except a few letters written after the 21st of April (p. 4⁴27). He
was murdered during the proscription of this year, Ro. 43, in the mouth
of December (“v11 Idus Decembres occisus est,'’ Tacit. Dialog. De Or.

c. 17), and in the sixty-fourth year of his age.

The MS. v which is quoted in the notes to this oration is thus de-
scribed by Hahn :—
