sam3 nunc ab utroque eas avulsas ne in angustum venirent. Quam
convenit nondum cognita populi voluntate hos, quos jam tum con-
· junctos fuisse dicis, jacturam suarum tribuum, quo vos adjuvare-
mini fecisse, eosdem, quum jam essent experti quid valerent, re-
strictos et tenaces fuisse? Etenim verebantur, credo, angustias,
quasi res in contentionem aut in discrimen aliquod posset venire.
Sed tamen tu A. Plotium, virum ornatissimum, in idem crimen
vocando indicas eum te arripuisse a quo non sis rogatus? Nam
quod questus es plures te testes habere de Voltinia quam quot in
ea tribu puncta tuleris, indicas aut eos testes te adducere, qui quia
nummos acceperint te praeterierint, aut te ne gratuita quidem
eorum suffragia tulisse. XXIII. Illud vero crimen de nummis,
quos in circo Flaminio deprehensos esse dixisti, caluit re recenti,
nunc in caussa refrixit 3 neque enim qui illi nummi fuerint, nec quae
tribus, nec qui divisor, ostendis. Atque is quidem eductus ad con-
sules, qui tum in crimen vocabatur, se inique a tuis jactatum gra-
viter querebatur; qui si erat divisor, praesertim ejus quem tu
habebas reum, cur abs te reus non est factus? cur non ejus damna-
tione aliquid ad hoc judicium praejudicii comparasti? Sed neque

charged Plotius with ‘coitio,’ as well as
Plancius, but he had only prosecuted Plan-
cius. Accordingly, says Cicero, ⁴ you show
that you have fastened on the man who
did not entreat you,' did not entreat you
not to prosecute, as Wunder says,
which I suppose is the meaning. Ma-
nutius had said the same, ‘ut eum ne
accusares.'

Nam quod] This sentence is intended
to explain that which precedes: ‘ For when
you complain that you have more witnesses
out- of the Voltinia than the number of
votes which you got in that tribe, you show
that you are either producing witnesses,
who did not vote for you because they
were bribed (by somebody else), or that
you did not get even their votes for no-
thing! Cicero speaks quite plain, but the
real meaning of his words is not plain.
Laterensis had said that Plancius had
bribed the Voltinia, and Laterensis also
said that he had witnesses to the fact out
of that ‘tribus,' and witnesses more iu
number than the votes which he got in
that ‘trihus' He could not mean to say
that thos-⁷¹ who votod sor him were brihed,
but if the tribe was bribed, he must. as
Cicero says, either bc producing some men
as witnesses who for a bribe had voted
against him, or if thoy were not bribed by

this looks something like playing with
words, thc fault is the orator's, or Ι have
not caught his meaning. But why does
Cicero say ‘you have complained,’ &c.,
instead of saying ‘you have boasted,’ or
something of the kind? I suppose he is
speaking ironically. Wunder remarks that
Weiske has erred past all belief in ex-
plaining this passage. But he has not cx-
plained it right himself: “negat Cicero
quos Laterensis de Voltinia testes se ha-
bere, eorum audiri testimonium posse.
Nam aut corrupti sunt, inquit, a Plancio,
ut te praeterirent, quo facto testes csse
non possint cum sint corrupti; aut tales
sunt, qui non corrupti a Plancio tamen
hunc maluerint quain te suffragiis suis
aedilem declarare: quo facto improbabile
est eos contra Plancium esse testimonium
dicturos, nisi pecunia a te empti ad testi-
monium prohibendum huc accesserint.''

(xi. 17), who quotes one of the old prue-
torian ‘edit-ta! ‘¹ Si quis eorum ml me
eductus fuerit.”——·praejudicii:’ if such ιι
inan had been convicted, his convicitur
would have formed a presumptum of l‘lnn-
