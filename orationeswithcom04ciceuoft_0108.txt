86 INTRODUC'PION.

election of the consuls and the time of the consuls taking possession of
them, and during this interval should be administered by praetors. He
also was of opinion that Caesar should keep his two provinces (c. 6
and 7).

Though Cicero had reason to complain of Caesar's behaviour towards
him in the matter of his exile from Rome, he thought it prudent now to
support his interests ; and two years later (13.0. 54) we find his brother
Quintus in Gallia, as one of Caesar’s legati.

Caesar had received his provinces for five yearS, to the end of Β.ο. 54,
but Caesar’s enemies at Rome wished to recall him before the times
The consul Marcellinus proposed to take from Caesar at least Gallia
Cisalpina (c. 7), and there were various other proposals‚ as the oration
shows. Crassus (Ad Fam. i. 9) defended Gabinius against Cicero’s
attacks, and Cicero replied in bitter language. Nothing was done as to
Caesar’s provinces, and in the next year (13.0. 55) he got them for five
years more. Gabinius also was not superseded for the present, but Piso
was in B.c. 55 (In Pison. e. 36).

The speech and the letters of Cicero, particularly the long letter to
Lentulus (Ad Fam. i. 9), explain the matter plain enough. The oration
Pro Sestio also, if it has been read, will help to explain this·
