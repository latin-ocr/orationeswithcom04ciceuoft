⁷ aliud est maledicere, aliud accusare.

GAP. 2, 3. 43
numquam tam acerbe feret M. Caelius ut eum paeniteat non
deformem esse natum. Sunt etenim ista maledicta pervulgata in
omnes, quorum in adolescentia forma et species fuit liberalis. Sed
⁸ Accusatio crimen desiderat,
rem ut definiat, hominem ut notet, argumento probet, teste con-
firmet. Maledictio autem nihil habet propositi praeter contume-
liam; quae si petulantius jactatur, convicium, si facetius, urbanitas
nominatur. Quam quidem partem accusationis admiratus sum et
moleste tuli potissimum esse Atratino datam. Neque enim decebat,
neque aetas illa postulabat, neque, id quod animadvertere poteratis,
pudor patiebatur optimi adolescentis in tali illum oratione versari.
Vellem aliqui ex vobis robustioribus hunc maledicendi locum sus-
cepisset; aliquanto liberius et fortius et magis more nostro refuta-
remus istam maledicendi licentiam. Tecum, Ati-atine, agam lenius,
quod et pudor tuus moderatur orationi meae, et meum erga te
parentemque tuum beneficium tueri debeo. Illud tamen te esse
admonitum volo: primum, qualis es talem te * existiment, ut,
quantum a rerum turpitudine abeS, tantum te a verborum libertate
sejungas; deinde, ut ea in alterum ne dicas, quae quum tibi falso
responsa sint, erubescas. Quis est enim cui via ista non pateat-3

minime me paenitet'' (Ad Attic. i. 20);
where he means that he is quite satisfied.
Examples are abundant.
rem ut definiat] An ‘ accusatio ' requires
a ‘ crimen :' it must contain a charge, and
such a charge as clearly states a fact or
facts. Hotmann remarks that hence the
Greeks use κατηγυρεῖσθαι, and this word
and κατηγορία have also the dialectic sense,
as Aristotle has it (Cat. c. 3): ὅταν ’ἕτερον
καθ’ ἑτέρου κατηγορῆτιιι. Garatoni thinks
that ‘ hominem ut notet ' is rather obscure,
and that it interrupts the connexion ot' the
sentence. But, as Orelli remarks, we have
this correspondence, ‘rem ut definiat . . .
argumento probet 3' and ‘ hominem ut notet
. . teste confirmet! It is a rapid mode of
expression, but plain enough. The ‘res,’
the matter, is to be clearly stated; the man
is to be well marked. The ‘ res ' supplies
matter for ‘ argumentum,' and the ‘ homo ’
is the object of the witnesses' testimony.
But besides the rhetorical reason there is a
better reason sor tho words ‘hominem ut
notet! The learned Italian does not seem
vo have known that a charge must not only
state the facts, but mark the man. A charge
is nothing when it is made against persons
who are not named. It would be what iu
our history is known under the name of a
general warraut, or an order to seize a per-

son or persons not named, but only described
in general terms as guilty of some offence.

si facetius, urbanitas] Of which Cicero
gives us such brautiful cxamples in his
speech In Vatinium and elsewhere.

beneficium] Manutius conjectures that
Cicero had defended Atratinus’ father. He
had served him in some way, we must sup-
pose, and he wished to preserve his kind
disposition towards him by a continuance of
the same behaviour.

talem te * existiment] C. Something
seems to be lost here.—‘responsa:' the
word appears to have the meaning of ⁴ re-
lata ;’ * if the same things were falsely
charged on you.’ ¹ Falso,’ says Ernesti,
means ¹ quamvis falso.’ A passage which
Abrami quotes from Phil. ix. does not ex-
plain the word ‘responsa‚’ but it contains
something to the purpose: ¹· Quid enim est
minus non dico oratoris sed hominis quam
id objicere adversario, quod iile si verbo
negaxit, non possit longius progredi qui
objecerit ?'’ A good· remark, from which
many might profit, who deal in calumny und
lios, who say that which they cannot prove,
and which is sometimes incapable oi' proot‘.
A simple denial‚ and even that is not always
necessary, shows that they are both sonis
und knaves when they must he content with
the ‹lt-niul and can say nothing more.
