280 ORAT. PRO GN. PLANCIO

dubium quin contentione et armis superior posset esse. Ergo illc
quum suum, non quum senatus factum defenderet, quum per-
severantiam sententiae suae, non salutem rei publicae retinuisset,
tamen, quod illud voluntarium vulnus accepit, justissimos omnium
Metellorum et clarissimos triumphos gloria et laude superavit,
quod et illos ipsos improbissimos cives interfici noluit, et ne quis
bonus interiret in eadem caede providit: ego tantis perieulis pro-
positis, quum, si victus essem, interitus rei publicae, si vicissem„
infinita dimicatio pararetur, committerem ut idem perditor rei
publicae nominarer ¹qui servator fuissem? XXXVII. Mortem
me timuisse dicis. Ego vero ne immortalitatem quidem contra
rem publicam accipiendam putarem, nedum emori cum pernicie rei
publicae vellem. Nam qui pro re publiea vitam ediderunt, licet me
desipere dicatis, numquam me hercule eos mortem potius quam
immortalitatem assequutos putavi. Ego vero si tum illorum im-
piorum ferro ac manu concidissem, in perpetuum res publica civile

praesidium salutis suae perdidisset. Quin etiam, si me vis aliqua

of leaving ‘constat' in the text. Baiter

must have the same meaning as ¹ si finem
keeps it. It is certain that it can be left

vincendi viderem 'in this chapter. He means,

out. The use of the relative often leads to
some confusion in the Roman writers, and
perhaps to careless writing. There is a
curious example at the end of c. 38. Here
the word ¹ audire ' pei-forms a double part ι
it serves the clause ‘ut potes,' and the in=
finitive ¹ cessisse.' If we translate this
Latin relative in the way most conformable
to our own idiom, the whole is plain: ¹ and
he, as you may learn from many . . retired.’
Bake refers to au apposite example in ¹the
De Off. i. 7 : ‘¹ Sed quoniam . . . creari.''

suum] Metellus’ refusal to swear to the
Lex of Saturninus (see Pro Sestio, c. 16,
and the note). Cicero would have been de-
fcnding the ‘ senatus factum ' if he had
stayed and fought, for the senate had con-
demned the conspirators, and Cicero merely
executed the sentence (Manutius)

quod illud] ‘quum illud,' Wunder. T.
E. have ‘ tamen ob illam quod.' Baiter
has ‘tamen ob illam caussam (1110(1,γ follow-
ing Klotz. The various readings show that
the ere is something wrong. The ‘volun-
tarium vulnus ’151 Metellus voluntary exile,
which prevented a great disturbance.

infinita] “Infinita dimicatio non es t
quae finem habeat nullum, sed quae cum
ingenti armorum vi, cui Cicero par esse non
poterat, futura sit, quae vis exercitu Caesaris
et delectu consulari constat'' (Garatoni).
It seems that* infinita,’ whatever it means,

I think, that if he had been defeated, there
would have been an end of the State, and if
he were victorious, that would not have
ended the struggle.

37. Mortem me timuisse] Perhaps he
did. He does not deny it. But he says
he could not have thought of accepting even
immortality contrary to the interests of the
State, much less could he have chosen to
die, when his death would have ruined the
State. ⁴ Immortality ' implies death, and a
death which would have brought him ‘im-
mortality,' what is commonly called a gloriors
death. As to Cicero’s notion of immortality
see ludes, Vol. iii„ Cicero.

ediderunt] This is preferred to the other
reading, ⁶ dediderunt.'—‘ civile praesidium ι’
as Cicero says ‘in perpetuum‚' he cannot
be speaking of himself only, but of all who
undertake to protect the State against
lmaves.—‘ natura ipsa:' he means a death
not by disease, for he has mentioned that,
but the exact meaning of ⁴ natura ipsa,' not-
withstanding Manutius has undertaken to
explain it, does not soem clear, unless we
take the explanation offered by the similar
passage in the Pro Sestio (c. 22): ‘non
solum si vi interissem, sed etiam si morbo
extinctus ess em! Again in this oration,
c. 42, he says:‘ ‘sin autem vitam mihi fors
ademisset aut vis aliqua major reditum per-
emisset.’⁷
