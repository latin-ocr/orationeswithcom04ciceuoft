CAP. 13, 14. 135
Insubrium, Helvetiorum, lapidum, nonnullorum item ex Gallia
barbarorum, quorum in foederibus exceptum est ne quis eorum a
nobis civis recipiatur. Quod si exceptio facit ne liceat, ibi necesse
est licere ubi non est exceptum. Ubi est igitur exceptum foedere
Gaditano, ne quem populus Romanus Gaditanum recipiat civitate?
Nusquam. Ac sicubi esset, lex id Gellia et Cornelia, quae definite
potestatem Pompeio civitatem donandi dederat. sustulisset. Ex-
ceptum, inquit‚ est foedus, si quidem sacrosanctum est. Ignosco
tibi si neque Poenorum jura calles, reliqueras enim civitatem tuam,

neque nostras potuisti leges inspicere;
Quid fuit in rogatione ea, quae de

sua judicio publico reppulerunt.

ipsae enim te a cognitione

Pompeio a Gellio et a Lentulo consulibus lata est, in quo aliquid

[sacrosanctum] exceptum videretur?

received the title of ¹ Rex atque amicus ’ from
the Roman Senate‚ apparently to keep him
quiet (In Vatin. c. 12, note). Madvig alters
‘Germanorum 'to ¹ Cenomanorum! P ¹.G.E.
have ¹genumanhorum,’ 1³2. ‘germanorum‚’
and the correction is nearly certain.—‘ Hel-
vetiorum:’ the Helvetii defeated the Ro-
mans 13.c. 107, and sent their army under
the yoke. Some foedus may have been
made with them after this battle (Caesar,

B. G. i. 7). The Insubres were Galli of '

Gallia Transpadana, whose capital was
Milan. They were now completely subju-
gated. The Iapides, Iapodes or Iapydes
were Illyrians, or a mixture of Celts and
111yrians, on both sides of the Albius Mons,
and east of Liburnia (Strabo, p. 207). They
were defeated B.c. 129 by C. Sempronius
Tuditanus (Appi-an, Illyr. c. 10). After
mentioning these nations Cicero says ¹ non—
nullorum item ex Gallia barbarorum ;' but
the Helvetii were Gallie Celtae3 and the
Insubres were Italian Galli. Cicero alludes
to the Aedui who were Celtae, and had
often been called ¹ fratres et consanguinei'
by the Roman Senate (Caesar, B. G. i. 33).
Cicero knew nothing about the Helvetii,
and he had not carefully read his friend
Caesar’s despatches of the year 13.c. 58, or
he would have known who they were.—
‘ibi . . . exceptum :' from the ed. Naug.
C. have only‘ubi necesse est licere.' Baiter
following Madvig has ⁸ ubi non est [sit.
Madv.] exceptum, ibi necesse est licere.'
Gellia et Cornelia] It might be inferred
that this Lex gave Pompeius power to con-
fer the civitas, and did not merely confirm
the civitas which hc had confer-red.-—‘ sacro-
sanctum est:y he explains this word after-
wards. Cicero has been arguing in this
fashion. We have a foedus with some na-

Primum enim sacrosanctum

tions by which we are not permitted to ad-
mit any of their people to our civitas. If
then this exception prevents us from doing
it, we can do it where there is no such ex-
ception. There is no such exception in the
foedus with the Gaditani; and if there were,
the Lex Gellia et Cornelia removes the ex-
ception by the power which it confers on
Pompeius. Cicero's opponent is supposed
still to object, and to say that a foedus is
excepted when it is sacrosanctum ; a foedus
which is sacrosanctum excludes every Lex.
Cicero shows that the foedus with Gades is
not ¹ sacrosanctum!

Poenorum jura] The prosecutor was
of Gades, and Gades was a Phoenician
colony. — ¹ judicio publico :’ the prose·
eutor had been convicted for something,
we must suppose. But Ι don't see how he
could not know the Roman Leges for that
reason. It seems that he could be a prose-
cutor. Pantag athus proposed‘ cognitione
sui, '‘and reete,y as Ursini says.

in quo aliquid [sacrosanctum] ] Panta-
gathus wrote¹ in quo! The MSS. have ‘ in
qua! Madvig erased ¹ sacrosanctum.' Hc
also writes ⁴ sanxit ¹ for ¹ sanxisset 3’ and he
may be right.

The ⁴ sanctiones ⁹ are the sanctions, that
which secures the observance of some rnle
or agreement. Madvig would write ‘ant
genere ipso atque obtestatione legis aut
poe11a;'and Nipperdey proposes gt 11( re
ipso aut obtestatione legis aut consecratione
personae' (Baiter). sacrosanc'tum is
defined by Festus (quoted by thr 11111) thus

“Sucrosanctuni (11( itur quodjurejurando 111-
terposito est institutum. si quis id violasset
ut morte p ‘enas penderttff'
