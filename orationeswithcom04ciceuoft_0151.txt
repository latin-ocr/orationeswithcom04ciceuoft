X. Hanc tu igitur, patrone foederum ac foederatorum, condi-
tionem statuis Gaditanis tuis civibus, ut, quod iis, quos magnis
adjutoribus tuis arinis subegimus atque in ditionem nostram rede-
gimus, liceat, si populus Romanus permiserit, ut ab senatu, ab

imperatoribus nostris. civitate donentur, id ne liceat ipsis?

Qui si

suis decretis legibusve sanxissent, ne quis suorum civium castra
imperatorum populi Romani iniret, ne quis se pro nostro imperio in
periculum capitis atque in vitae discrimen inferret, Gaditanorum
auxiliis quum vellemus uti nobis non liceret, privatus vero ne quis

jus] ‘jus et fortunae conditio' in some
editions ; but it does not appear that there
is any authority for the ‘et.y P1. G. E.
have ‘ fortunae.' Baiter has ⁴ fortuna.' If
‘jus ’ is genuine, ⁴ fortunae ' in the plural is
genuine, and the meaning is whose ‘legal
state, fortunes, and condition 3⁷ for ¹ for-
tunae’ means a man's goods, all that he
has. But the ‘quorum jus' is doubtful,
especially when said of slaves, ‘ Jus ¹ with
a genitive referring to persons means the
law about persons, or the law which deter-
mines the legal condition of persons (jus
personarum). If ⁶ quorum jus ' is Latin,
it must be understood in the same way
as ‘jus Quiritium ' is. However a slave had
no ‘jus ² in any sense of the word: he was
an object of laW, because he was a thing
that had a value, but he had no rights
(legal) ; and ‘jus ’ was no more applicable
to him than to a horse : “quod attinet ad
jus civile servi pro nullis habentur'’ (Dig.
50. 17. 32): “quia servile caput nullum
jus habet. ideo nec minui potest ⁷' (Dig. 4.
5. 3). If then Cicero said ‘quorum jus,’
he spoke of human beings who had no
‘jus ;’ and if he said ‘quorum fortunae‚’ he
said this of human beings who could not
have property.

⁴ Jus ' and ¹ vis ’ are written alike iu the
old MSS„ and though ‘vis ' may not be the
true reading, ‘ vi ' may be, as Graevius says,
and Cicero may have written, ‘quorum vi
fortunae conditio infima est.'

libertate . . . publice] ‘ Presented with
their freedom bytho state ' (publice). Becker
(llaudhuch διο. 11Δ p. 76) refers to the ora-
tion Pro Rabir. perduell. c. ll, und to Livy,
26, c. 27, who speaks of thirteen slaves who
had saved Vesta's temple from fire being
purchased by the state aud manumitted.
Becker supposes that the manumissio was

VOL. lv-

effectcd by the Vindicta. Cicero tells us that
this ‘libertas ' was equivalent to the ‘ciri-
tas.' When Gaius wrote there were three
classes of libertini, who were either ‘cives
Romani,' or ‘ Latini,’ or ‘ dediticii ;’ and he
says (i. l7): “nam in cujus persona tria
haec concurrunt, ut major sit annorum tri-
ginta, et ex jure Quiritium domiui et justa
ae legitima manumissione liberetur, id est,
vindicta aut censu aut testamento, is ciris
Romanus fit: sin vero aliquid eorum deerit,
Latinus erit.'' lf a slave was emancipated
at Rome, being no longer a slave he must
have been either Peregrinus or Civis, in
some sense of the word ⁸ eivis.’ ln the
earlier periods of Roman history when a
slave was emaneipated, he cannot have been
in a better condition than the plebeian class ;
and the fact of having been a slave always
deprived him of the character of Ingenuus.
The precise condition of a manumitted slave
then must bc ‹letermined by looking at the
several times of the Roman history, and
Cicero’s remark, which may be taken as ex-
pressing a general truth, is not one. from
which any precise informatiou can be got.

10. luis cil-ibus] The prosecutor was
originally a Gaditanus, but had become a
civis Romanus in some way. as it seems
(see c. 14).

nmquis adjutoribus luis armis] This is
clearly corrupt. Madvig supposes that
under ‘ tuis ’ the word ⁸ illis ’ may lurk.-
⁴ ditionem :¹ ‘conditionem ’ G. E.-· nou
liceret2' C. Madrig erases ⁸ non,' aud
Baiter follows him. There is something to
be said both for the ⁸ non’ and against it.

privatus] P. G., ⁴ privatim ’ E.—
‘ patria z' E„ ‘paterna ' l‘. G., Baiter. The
Juntina has ⁴ i·x1ei·1ui,' which appears in 1111·
editions, but it looks like a correction made
to fit the word ‘alienigenarum.' llalm pro-
