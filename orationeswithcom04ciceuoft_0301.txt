GAP. 35, 36. 279

profecto non videbam] Ubi enim mihi praesto fuissent aut tam
fortis consul quam L. Opimius, quam C. Marius, quam L. Flaccus?
quibus ducibus improbos cives res publica vicit armatis; aut si
minus fortes, at tamen tam justi quam P. Mucius, qui arma, quae
privatus P. Scipio sumpserat, ea. Ti. Graccho interempto jure
optimo sumpta esse defendit? Esset igitur pugnandum cum con·
sulibus. Nihil dico amplius nisi illud: victoriae nostrae graves ad-
versarios paratos, interitus nullos [esse] ultores videbam. Hisce
ego auxiliis salutis meae si idcirco defui, quia. nolui dimicare,
fatebor, id quod vis, non mihi auxilium, sed me auxilio defuisse.
Sin autem, quo majora studia in me bonorum fuerunt, hoc iis
magis consulendum et parcendum put-avi, tu id in me reprehendis,
quod Q. Metello laudi datum est hodieque est et semper erit
maximae glorian quem, ut potes ex multis audire qui tuin

affuerunt, [constat] invitissimis

. . nisi cernerent? which means ‘they
did not attempt such great things without
seeing.’ Again, in this chapter, ‘nec fuisse
dubium quin . . . posset esse ;’ ‘itis cer-
tain that there was no doubt about the pos-
sibility of his being victorious.¹ In this
passage ‘ vidissem,' which the ‘tirones ⁷
would have expected, would spoil Cicero's
meaning, who says in substance, though not
in form, ⁴ I confess it was a noble thing, but
I did not then see a termination to the vic-
tory! The examples from the Verrine
orations alone of the cases in which one
tense or the other is used, are innumerable.
Cicero says (ii. 3. 58): “tu unquam tan-
tam plagam accipere potuisses, nisi hoc ita
statuisses ?'’ ‘ would you ever have been
able to bear such a blow, if you had not
first made up your mind about this, that ' &c.:
(ii. 5. 58) : “si qui rex . . fecisset aliquid . .
ejusmodi, nonne publice vindicaremus ?'’ ⁴ if
any king had done any thing of the kind,
should we not punish him ?’

tum vincendi] ¹ Tum ’ is a better reading
than ‘ eum,' which Wunder says Cicero
could not have written, and he explains why
he could not have written it. The explana-
tion seems to me worth little. He also re-
tains ‘ quern . . vi‹lebam,' which words are
omitted in T. E.; and he contends that if
we omit them, there is a want of connex-
ion between this sentence and the next.
But I do not think that he establishes this
satisfactorily.

Ubi enim milei praesto fuissent] Wun-
der refers to the Pro Sestio, c. 19. It is
tedious to be always telling the render what
he well knows, if hc knows much of Cicero.

viris bonis cessisse, nee fuisse

He employs some of his characters as regu-
larly as Terence does a Davus or a Geta.
As to Opimius see c. 28. L. Valerius Flac-
cusis C. Marius’ colleague in the consul-
ship (Pro C. Rabirio, c. 7). Baiter has
‘fortes consules.' P. Mucius is Scaevola,
consul in the year in which T. Gracchus
was killed. P. Scipio Nasica was Pontifex
Maximus at that time (In Cat. i. l).
sumpserat] T. Ε. have ‘eeperat;’ and
Baiter. Wunder has ‘sumpserat,’ and a
very long note on the difference between
¹ capere arma ¹ and ‘ sumere arma,’ which
the curious must read themselves. 110 cor·
rectly remarks that ⁴ sumpserat ’ is the right
word here, as the word ‘ sumpta ¹ shows.

Q. Metello] Wunder remarks that
Cicero very often compares himself with
Q. Metellus Numidicus. ’Tis quite true,
and very tiresome. To give a little variety
in the history of Metellus, 1 refer the read-:r
to a chapter in Gellius (i. 6), where we
learn something of his opinions about niar-
mage.

[constat] ] Bake proposed to eject this
word as an interpolation, and he finds some
evidence of interpolation in the fact of the
word not occupying the same place in all
the MSS. But that. argument goes too far.
llis chief objectiou is that ‘ cx multis audire
potes ’ and ⁸ constat ’ are very iucptly joined.
If ⁴ constat ’ is left out, we have au ⁸ exqui-
sita et vere Ciceroniana structura! lle
adds ‘¹ saepius enim constructio c relativo
suspensa non absolvitur, scd ad proxumum
se accommodat3'' the precise meaning pf
which the render may excreise himself in
finding out. Wunder in his note repents
