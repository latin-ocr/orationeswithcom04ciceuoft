contubernalis, castissimo viro atque omnis officii diligentissimo: in
qua provincia quum res erant et possessiones paternae, tuin etiam
usus quidam provincialis non sine caussa a majoribus huic aetati
tributus. Decessit illinc Pompeii judicio probatissimus, ut ipsius
testimonio cognoscetis. Voluit vetere instituto, eorum adoles-
centium exemplo, qui post in civitate summi viri et clarissimi cives
exstiterunt, industriam suam a populo Romano ex aliqua illustri
accusatione cognosci. XXXI. Vellem alio potius eum cupiditas
gloriae detulisset: sed abiit hujus tempus querelae. Accusavit O.
Antonium, collegam meum; cui misero praeclari in rem publicam
beneficii memoria nihil profuit, nocuit opinio maleficii cogitati.
Postea nemini umquam concessit aequalium, plus ut in foro, plus ut
in negotiis versaretur caussisque amicorum, plus ut valeret inter
suos gratia. Quae nisi vigilantes homines, nisi sobrii, nisi industrii,
consequi non possunt, omnia labore et diligentia est consecutus.
In hoc flexu quasi aetatis, nihil enim occultabo fretus humanitate
ac sapientia vestra, fama adolescentis paullum haesit ad metas
notitia nova mulieris et infelici vicinitate et insolentia voluptatum;
quae quum inclusae diutius, et prima aetate compressae et con-
strictae suerunt, subito se nonnumquam profundunt atque ejiciunt
universae. Qua ex vita, vel dicam, quo ex sermone, nequaquam

against Catilina, Cicero we must suppose
gives him the glory of the victory. But
Antonius was sick on the battle day. and

Africa after his praetorship. Africa is the
Roman province of Africa. Caelius accom-
panied Pompeius after Roman fashion to

learn something of public administration by
being about the governor. It appears that
Caelius' father, who was a Roman eques,
had business there (res) and lands (posses-
siones) ς and this was one reason for sending
the youth there to look after his father's
affairs. The other reason for his going to
Africa was to get experience in provincial
administration. — ‘ viro ι ’ ‘ homini,’ A.
Halm.

Decessit] A. ‘ discessit ¹ P. S. ⁴ discedens·
G. “Verbo decedendi in privatis quoque
uti Ciceronem satis constat’' (Bake quoted
by Halm). This is true, but not always
admitted. See Pro Archia, c. 4, and the
note on ‘satis longo intervallo.’—‘ vetere
instituto :’ according to an old practice
young men who aspir-ed to politica} honours
began by prosecuting some man who had
attained these honours and brought himself
by his acts within the penalties of some
Lex. (See c. 7.)

his legatus Petreius defeated the rebels.
The ‘ opinio maleficii ¹ was the belief that
he was implicated in Catilina’s conspiracy.
Compare what Cicero says Iu Pisonem,
c. 2.

In lzoc flexu quasi aetatis] ⁴ At this
which we may eall the turning point in his
age.’ The metaphor is taken from the
chariot-race in the Circus, asrthe words
⁴ haesit ad metas’ show. Garatoni observes
that he does not say ‘ad metam,’ but ‘ ad
metas‚' for the ⁴ spina ' of the Circus had a
⁴ meta ’ at each eud, each ‘meta'consisting of
three eones on one base. Caelius got out
of his course through a fresh intimacy (nova
notitia) with a woman, and an unlucky
vicinity to her. ⁴ Notitia ¹ is used by
Terence, Heauton. (i. l, l) in the sense of
acquaintance.

He makes another apology sor Caelius,
his ‘insolentia voluptatum,' his ⁸ inexpe-
rience in measure) lle had been brought
up strictly, and when ho cuine ns we say to
bc his own master, his passinus hitherto re-
pressed brokc loose. He fell into the hands
of a bad woman, as Cicero means to athrm.
