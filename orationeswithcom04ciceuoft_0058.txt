36 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO.

The passages which relate to the Lex Plautia de vi are few. They
are the following, as referred to by Waechter :—

1. Asconius, ad Ciceronis orat. Pro Milone (p. 55, ed. Orelli).

2. Sallust (Cat. e. 31) says that Catilina was accused under the Lex

Plautia (Introduction to the Orations against Catilina, Vol. iii.
p. 6).
3. It is mentioned in the spurious oration of Sallust against Cicero,
i. 3.
4. It appears to be alluded to in the passage De Haruspicum Re.
sponsis, c. 8.
5. Cicero (Ad Atticum, ii. 24) says “Nunc reus erat apud Crassum
Divitem Vettius de vi,'’ which appears to be another allusion ‘co this
Lex Plautia.
Orelli adds to these passages one in the Schol. Bob. ad orat. Pro Sulla,
p. 368.

The date of this Lex Plautia is uncertain. It has been fixed at the
year Rc. 89 (Vol. ii. p. 140), and the proposer is supposed to have been
a tr. pl. M. Plotius Silvanus3 but it must be admitted that there is
really no evidence for this, as Waechter shows. Nor, as already re-
marked, is there any evidence for a Lex Lutatia de vi except the passage
in this oration, which has been referred to above. Still Cicero in this
passage does speak distinct-ly of a Lex of Catulus and a Lex de vi. We
may conclude, says Waechter‚ from the passage of Sallust (2) that the
Lex Plautia was enacted before A.U.c. 690 (691), the year in which
Catilina received notice of this prosecution (B.c. 63). But though
there may be no direct evidence for the existence of this Lex at an
earlier date, it is very probable that it was enacted some time before Bc.
63 (Vol. ii. pp. 139, 140).

The provisions of the Lex Plautia cannot be determined with any
exactness. They seem to have been directed against carrying arms,
violence against magistrates, riots, getting men together for the purpose
of using violence, the forcible occupation of public places and houses, and
the destruction of houses (Waechter). Accordingly the provisions of the
Lex Plotia agree with what Paulus (Sentent. Recept. v. 26, ed. Arndts)
says of the Lex J ulia de vi privata: “ Lege J ulia de vi privata tenetur qui
quem armatis hominibus possessione, domo, villa agrove dejecerit, expug-
naverit, obsederit, cluserit, idve ut fieret homines commodaverit, loca-
verit, conduxerit3 quive coetum, concursum, turbam, seditionem, incen-
dium fecerit—-quive cum telo in publico fuerit, templa, portas, aliudve
quid publicum armatis obsederit, cinxerit, clauserit, occupaverit. Quibus
omnibus convictis si honestiores sint, tertia pars bonorum eripitur et in
insulam relegantur, humiliores in metallum damnantur.’' It is thus cer-
tain that the Lex J ulia de vi followed the Lex Plautia in substance and
