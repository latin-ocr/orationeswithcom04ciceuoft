PRO M. MARCELLO

ORATIO.

INTRODUOTION.

M. CLAUDIUS MARCELLUS, a friend of Cicero, was consul in no. 51,
with Servius Sulpicius for his colleague. Cicero tells us that Marcellus
had been Curule Aedile in the same year as P. Clodius, Rc. 563 and that
he aided Milo on his trial for the murder of P. Clodius. In his consul-
ship Marcellus moved in the senate that Caesar should be superseded in
his government of the Galliae before the expiration of the time for which
the provinces were given to him by the Lex Trebonia‚ or as Hirtius
(B. C. viii. 53) calls it, the Lex of Pompeius and Crassus.

We must be careful 111 reading the history of the troubles which pre-
ceded Caesar’s invasion os Italy, to remember that there were three
Marcelli consuls in three successive years: M. Claudius Marcellus 111
11.6.51; C. Claudius Marcellus in B.c. 50, who was the cousin of M.
Marcellus ; and C. Claudius B.c. 49, 1116 brother of M. Marcellus.

M. Marcellus (13.6. 51) failed in his attempt to deprive Caesar of his
provinces. In 136. 50 the attempt was again made, and again it failed;
but a Senatus Consultum was passed by which Caesar was deprived of
two legions, on the pretence that they were wanted for the Parthian
war. Early in 13.c. 49, in the consulship of O. Claudius Marcellus and
L. Gemellus Lentulus, Caesar crossed the Rubicon and occupied Ari-
minum. Cicero, in a letter to Atticus written in October or November
Β.6. 50, after 116 1111(1 got to Athens on his return from Cilicia, speaks of
the deliberations about Caesar's provinces during the former consulships
of the Marcelli, by which he means the Marcelli of 51 and 50. In uc.
49 there was another Marcellus consul.
