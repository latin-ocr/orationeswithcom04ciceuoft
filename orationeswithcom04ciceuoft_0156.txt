134 ORAT. PRO L. CORNELIO BALBO

neve in civitate maneat invitus. Haec sunt enim fundamenta
firmissima nostrae libertatis, sui quemque juris et retinendi et
dimittendi esse dominum. Illud vero sine ulla dubitatione maxime
nostrum fundavit imperium, et populi Romani nomen auxit, quod
princeps ille, creator hujus urbis, Romulus foedere Sabino docuit
etiam hostibus recipiendis augeri hanc civitatem oportere. Cujus
auctoritate et exemplo numquam est intermissa a majoribus nostris
largitio et communicatio civitatis. Itaque et ex Latio multi et
Tusculani et Lanuvini, et ex ceteris generibus gentes universae in·
civitatem sunt receptae, ut Sabinorum, Volscorum, Hernicorum; ·
quibus ex civitatibus nec coacti essent civitate mutari, si qui
noluissent, nec, si qui essent civitatem nostram beneficio populi
Romani consecuti, violatum foedus eorum videretur.

that these words are not genuine. I do not
see why they should not be genuine. The
remark is good ‘dissimilitudo enim civi-
tatum varietatem juris habeat necesse est,’

Baiter prints The Greek, who was no critical investigator
of facts, has drawn a true politica] lesson
from the story of Romulus. The literal
truth or falsehood of the story is an idle
question. The fact is certain that Rome

from an early time grew by receiving

for the reasons which I have given3 not for
Manutius’ silly reason: ‘⁴ neminem autem
decet vario jure vivere.’' And the rest is
good too. Freedom consists in a man being
able to retain his condition as a citizen of
his own country if he chooseS, or to give it
up if he likes, and go to another country, if
he can find one which will accept him.
England admits the foreigner to a limited
citizenship without troubling herself about
the way that other states will view the act,
and she refuses to release her own citizens
from their duty to her. The United States
of North America admit foreigners also to
their citizenship after five years' residence
and complying with certain forms3 but the
foreigners must be free white persons. For
the first time in the history of the world a
man’s political condition is made to depend
on his colour. But the existence of coloured
slaves in America explains this strange rule.
Ι believe it is doubtful whether by American
law 311 American citizen can renounce his
citizenship.

Illud vero] Here Cicero tells us 0116 of
the causes of Rome’s greatness. She re-
ceived even enemies, and made them citi-
zens. Abrami quotes Dionysius (Antiq.
Rom. ii. c. 16), who commends the wisdom
of Romulus who established a state with a
few thousand men, and left forty-six thou-
sand in it. Dionysius blames Lycurgus
and other Greeks for their exclusive rules.

foreigners, as England and the United States
have done and still do. Rome did not shut
out the rest of mankind, uot even her
enemies. Machiavelli has briefly touched
on this difference between Rome and Athens
and Sparta in his chapter entitled, ‘⁴ Rome
became a great state by ruiniug the neigh-
bouring states and admitting foreigners
easily to her honours.'’ (Discorsi ii. 3.)

Baiter—⁴ generibus? Baiter has ‘regioni-
bus‚' an emendation of Rumpfius, and a
very bad one.——‘ Volscorum 2' C. have ‘uui-
scorum.' The emendation is an old one
and very obvious, both from the context
and the corrupted form. Probably there is
also a MSS. reading ‘ Volscorum!

civitate mutari] ‘ civitatem mutare ’ G2.
Ι do not know what the other MSS. have.
I suppose it is ⁴ civitate mutari‚’ which
Baiter has. Klotz quotes Festus (p. 53,
Lindem.) ε “ Deminutus capite appellabatur
qui civitate mutatus est et ex alia familia in
aliam adoptatus;’' remarking that the last
editor, inconsiderately enough, has changed
‘ mutatus ’ into ¹ multatus?

be ‘ at enim.’——‘ Cenomanorum :' the com·
