ORAT. IN P. VATINIUM TESTEM

tyrannos vocas, fuerisne non tribunus pl„ sed intolerandus ex caeno
nescio qui atque ex tenebris tyrannus? qui primum eam rem pub-
licam, quac auspiciis inventis constituta est, iisdem auspiciis sublatis
conarere cvertcrc, deinde sanctissimas leges, Aeliam et Fufiam
dico, quac in Gracchorum ferocitate, et in audacia Saturnini, et in
colluvione Drusi, ct in contentione Sulpicii, et in cruore Cinnano,
etiam iuter Sullana arma vixerunt, solus conculcaris ac pro nihilo
putaris ; qui consulem morti objeceris, inclusum obsederis, extrahere
ex suis tectis conatus sis; qui in eo magistratu non modo emerseris
ex mendicitate, sed etiam divitiis nos jam tuis terreas; fuerisne
tanta crudelitate, ut delectos viros et principes civitatis tollere et

delere tua rogatione conarere?

‘ardour,’ the violence of temperament not
restrained by prudence and experienee. We
read a good deal about Saturninus in the
oration Pro C. Rabirio, Vol. ii. Livius
Drusus is the tribune of 13.c. 91, who at-
tempted to give the ‘civitas' to the Italians,
or to the Latins only, as some writers
maintain (Weiland, De Bello Marsico, p.
38). The ‘ colluvio ’ is the confusion which
was caused by the attempt to introduce so
many new citizens. Halm remarks that
Asconius, in Cornel. p. 68, says that the
Leges of Drusus were enaeted ⁴ contra
auspicia‚’ and accordingly the consul Phi-
lippus induced the senate to declare them
null.

P. Sulpicius is the tribune and great
orator, a partizan of Marius. See In Cat.
iii. 10, note; Phil. viii. 2.

in cruore Cinnano] Halm refers to
Becker, Alt. ii. l, p. 171. Becker refers to
Liv. Epit. 79 : ‘⁴ L. Cornelius Cinna quum
perniciosas leges per vim atque arma ferret3’'
where the allusion is supposed to 'ne to the
recall of the banished C. Marius.

consulem morti] Manutius explains this
by referring to the words (c. 9) ‘ quum M. Bi-
bulum consulem . . . non in carcerem sed ad
supplicium et ad necem duceretur3’ on which
passage Halm says : “ scilicet orator rem ita
describit, quasi Vatinius, quum Bibulum in
carcerem duci pararet, id egerit ut per oc-
casionem tumultus consul necaretur;” which
is a probable explanation. Here he says
against Manutius, that Cicero in the other
passage speaks of what Vatinius attempted
to do, but did not do, for he did not succeed
in carrying Bibulus off to prison.

Accordingly Halm would rather refer for
the explanation of this passage to what Ap-
pian (B. C. ii. ll), and Dion Cassius (38,
c. 6), he says, “have reported as having

happened at the same time3 that Bibulus,
who was opposing Caesar’s Lex, was thrown
down the steps of Castor's temple, his fasces
were broken, and some people were wound-
ed, and the tribunes among thern. Bibulus
however would not yield, and his friends
carried him off unwillingly to the temple of
Jupiter Stator.''

Halm however has already observed
that Cicero tells the story as if Bibulus was
carried off to prison, and he adds ‘⁴ that
matters did not go so far, but that his
friends, as Appian says (ii. 11), carried him
off to Stator’s temple.’⁷ But it seems that
Appian's story and Cicero’s are quite dif-
ferent. Cicero would certainly have us be-
lieve that Bibulus got no help, for he asks,
⁴ If any man ever before when he was going
to take a consul to prison, constructed a
passage in such a way that no one could get
at him to help him! Appian says nothing
of Vatinius attempting to impr-ison Bibulus.
Dion Cassius, who does speak of it, places
this attempt of Vatinius after the memo-
rable day when Bibulus was kicked down
the steps. But Dion’s story of Vatinius at-
tempting to take Bibulus to prison only
agrees with Cicer0,when he says, ‘januae pre-
sidio . . . miserisne viatorem qui M. Bibulum
domo vi extraheret) Manutius’ explanation
makes Cicero agree with himself; and Halm's
puts the whole story in confusion.

non modo] ‘ modo ' om. P. G. 3 and Her-
mann thinks that it ought to be omitted;
but he is mistaken 3 and so Halm seems to
think in his last edition, for he observes
that in the passages quoted by C. F. Her-
mann in support of his opinion <Now Mus.
Rhenan. iv. p. 447), either ‘ sed ' only
follows ‘ non m0d0‚' and not ‘sed etiam,’
or they are a different kind of passage.
See Vol. i. remarks on ‘ non m0d0‚'
