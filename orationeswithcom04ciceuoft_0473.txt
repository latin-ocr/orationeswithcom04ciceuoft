TO THE PHILIPPIGAE. 451

He was made Consul for ten years and Dictator for life (Appiam, B. O.
ii. 106). Antonius was the foremost of his flatterers, the man of all
work, and no doubt he was well paid for it. It is said that it was on
his proposal that the fifth month of the old Roman year, Quintilis, in
which Caesar was born, was named Julius, which name it has ever since
retained (Dion Cassius, 44, c. 5, and the note of Reimarus). The Die-
tator's person was declared sacred. All that he did was to have full
legal effect3 or, as Appian expresses it, all the magistrates on their acces-
sion to office, were bound to swear that they would obey all the orders
of Caesar. This was like the oath of allegiance to a modern usurper, or
even more than allegiance3 it was absolute submission to a despot.
Finally he was deified as Divus Julius ². A temple was erected to his
Clemency, and Antonius was made the priest‚ doubtless with a salary.
Jupiter had his Flamen, Mars had his Flamen, Quirinus had his Flamen,
and O. Caesar, the new god, had for his Flamen Antonius (Phil. ii. c. 43 3
Dion, 44, c. 6).

In 13.c. 44 Antonius was further rewarded. He was the colleague of
Caesar in the consulship. M. Aemilius Lepidus was the Magister
Equitum of the Dictator. A Lex was passed on the proposal of L.
Antonius, that before Caesar set out on his Parthian expedition, for
which he had made preparation, he should have power to name the
chief magistrates and governors of provinces3 and he did name the Con-
suls and Tribuni plebis for the next two years (13.0. 43, 42), and the
governors of the provinces also. The consul Antonius, at the Luper-
calia (15th February) attempted to give Caesar all that he still wanted,
a royal name. He presented him with a crown of bay, within which a
diadem was visible, the symbol of the kingly name and title, and he put
it on Caesar’s head, or attempted to put it on, for the story is told with
variations. Caesar however, it is said, seeing that the crowd really did not
like the assumption of a kingly name, ordered the crown to be deposited
in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. Another story says that the
crown was placed on Caesar’s statue, which was the same thing as put-
ting it on his head ³.

² In the text of Dion it is said (44, 0. 6) καὶ τέλος Δία τε αὐτὸν ἄντικρυς Ἰούλιον
προσηγόρευσαν. It is hardly probable that he was called Jupiter Julius. Reimarus
approves of the proposed correction Δῖον (divum) in plac-e of Δία. This deification was
after eastern fashiom for the Greek kings of Syria and Egypt were named G0d; but
whether this Roman adulation was an imitation of eastern servility or an original idea, Ι
don’t know. Even now-a-‹lays kings are investcd with Majesty. Caesar had only Cle-
mency. His title would be Your Clemency ; and he deserved that. lle might also have
been addressed Your Foolishness ; for none but a man whose head was turned would have
accepted all this silly flattery‚ which did not increase his power, but made his enemics
more biti er, and Caesar himself contemptible.

³ This story about the diadem is told at some length in the Life of Caesar by Nicolaus
