OAP. 6. 41]

cum sceleratis an ut cum bonis civibus conveniret? Mihi vero,
Caesar, tua in me maxima merita tanta certe non viderentur, si me
ut sceleratum a te conservatum putarem. Quomodo autem tu de re
publica bene meritus esses, quum tot sceleratos incolumi dignitate
esse voluisses? Secessionem tu illam existimavisti, Caesar, initio,
non bellum, neque hostile odium, sed civile discidium; utrisque
cupientibus rem publicam salvam, sed partim consiliis, partim stu-
diis a communi utilitate aberrantibus. Principum dignitas erat
paene par, non par fortasse eorum qui sequebantur; caussa tum
dubia, quod erat aliquid in utraque parte quod probari posset;
nunc melior ea judicanda est quam etiam dii adjuverunt. Cognita
vero clementia tua, quis non eam victoriam probet, in qua occiderit

nemo nisi armatus Ξ

that the conditions will be accepted, if Cae·
sar will remove his garrisons from the
towns which he had occupied in order that
the senate might deliberate on them in
safety at Rome. This proposal came to
nothing and the war was continued. There
is also a letter from Caesar to Oppius (Ad
Att. ix, 7) in which he speaks of his great
desire for peace. Oppius gave Cicero the
letter or a copy of it, and Cicero sent a
copy to Atticus, and thus Caesar’s letter has
been preserved. If Caesar was sincere, and
Cicero told Atticus that he thought so, we
may conclude that he would have avoided
war if he cou1d3 but still he would have
been the first man in Rome; he would have
had the consulship again, and perhaps he
might have attained his ends with less
trouble to himself (Ad Att. vii. 15). In
his addi-ess to his soldiers before the battle
of Pharsalia, Caesar also reminded them
of his repeated proposals for peace (B. C.
iii. 90). Velleius (ii. 49) says that Caesar
left no means untried to bring about peace,
and that the faction of Pompeius rejected
all offers. Plutarch (Antonius) forms a
different judgment, when 110 says that
Caesar cagerly desired the war, and was
seized with an insatiable love of dominion
and a furious desire to bc the first and
greatest. But neither of these writers is
sufficient authority for either of these facts.

There is a curious admission by Cicero in a
letter to Atticus (viii. 3). written n.c. 49, after
Cacsar had got possession of Picenum. lle
was delibcruting what he should do if Pom—
peius left Italy, which Cicero suspected that
he would do. If Cicero stayed in Italy, 110
would be ‹leserting ‘⁴ all the best and most
illustrious citizens who would accompany
Pompeius; and he must full into the hands
of one man, who bad in many ways shown

that he was a friend to Cicero ;’' and, he
adds, “you know that I have long since
taken pains that he should be my friend,
because I expected this impending storm.’'

Principum diqnz'cas] Compare Pro Mar-
cello, c. 10 and the note. The words
‘Principum . . . sequebantnr' are quoted
by Quintilian ix. 3. 36; and the words
‘caussa . . . adjuverunt,’ v. 1⁴. l. Abrami
thinks that the ‘dignitas ⁷ of Pompeius was
superior. His career was certainly very
remarkable, and if he had written Corn-
mentarii like Caesar, we might have formed
a better estimate of his merit. Abrami
reminds us that when Pompeius took Jeru—
salem he did not plundcr the temple, and
that Caesar, as Suetonius says (Julius, c.
54), robbed the sacred places in Gallia which
were full of offerings. Of course Caesar
says nothing of this, and we may doubt if
he would have found much in the Gallie
templeS, particularly as in most parts of
Gallia there were none.

nonparsortasse] Cicero in a letter to
Atticus (vii. 3) describes Caesar's followcrs
in the civil war as consisting of all the worst
men, men who had been convictcd of crime
or who deserved to be : ‘⁴ Omnes qni aere
alieno premantur, quos plures 0550 intelligo
quam putaram: caussam solum illa caussa
non habet3 ceteris rebus abundat.'' There
was some truth in this. Cacsar had the
insolvents with him, and they are always thc
ready tools of a usurper, as we have 50011 by
a recent example in Franco. Velluius (ii.
49) making a contrast between thc factiuns
of Caesar and Pompeius does it with more
temper and justice. There ποι-1· reasons
however why he should spcak 115 111· did.
The party of Pompeius was thc nohility. but
many of these men also were spcndthrins
and insolvcnts.
