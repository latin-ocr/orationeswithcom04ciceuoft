74 ORAT. PRO M. CAELIO
centi et bono, Caelii familiari ; constitutum factum esse cuin servis,
ut venirent ad balneas Senias; eodem Licinium esse venturum atque
iis veneni pyxidem traditurum. Hic primum illud requiro, quid
attinuerit ficri in eum locum constitutum; cur illi servi non ad
Caelium domum venerint. Si manebat tanta illa consuetudo Caelii,
tanta familiaritas cum Clodia, quid suspicionis esset, si apud Caelium
mulieris servus visus esset? Sin autem jani suberat simultas, ex-
stincta erat consuetudo, discidium exstiterat, hinc illae lacrimae
nimirum, et haec caussa est omnium horum scelerum atque cri-s
1ninum.—-Immo, inquit, quum servi ad dominam rem istam et male-
ficium Caelii detulissent, mulier ingeniosa praecepit suis omnia
Caelio pollicerentur; sed ut venenum, quum a Licinio traderetur,
manifesto comprehendi posset, constitui locum jussit, balneas
Senias, ut eo mitteret amicos qui delitiscerent, deinde repente,
quum venisset Licinius, venenum traderet, prosilirent hominemque
comprehenderent.—-XXVI. Quae quidem omnia, judices, perfacilem
rationem habent reprehendendi. Cur enim potissimum balnea-s
publicas constituerat? in quibus non invenio quae latebra togatis
hominibus esse posset. Nam si essent in vestibulo balnearum, non
laterent: sin se in intimum conjicere vellent, nec satis commode
calceati et vestiti id facere possent et fortasse non reciperentur,
nisi forte mulier potens quadrantaria illa permutatione familiaris

both of them friends of Cicero, and both
charged by the prosecutors at once. This
is an instructive instance of the folly of
guessing. But where was P. Crassus in
Rc. 56, the year of this trial ? He was in
Aquitania, where he conducted a campaign
with great ability, and he only failed to
secure the submission of the people in the
upper valleys of the Pyrenees, because the
winter was coming on. (Caesar, Β. G. iii.
27.) He was at the foot of the Pyrenees
till the beginning of winter in 13.c. 56, and
he had been with Caesar in Gallia from ac.
58.—‘constitutum:’ see Pro P. Quintio, c.
5, Vol. ii.—‘ Senias :' Halm notices no other
reading. Some editions have Xenias.

hinc illae lacrimae] The words of
Terence (Andria i. l, v. 99), whom Cicero
often quotes. It was no doubt an expression
used in common talk. Cicero supposes that
Caelius, and Clodia had quarrelled‚ and that
would explain the whole matter. Perhaps
he was tired of the woman and left her, and
such a woman would not forgive the insult.
Muretus, says Abrauui, collected eight ex-
amples of women turning furious, when
they were neglected or despised. W. Canter

added five more, a rich addition to psycho-
logical science. Potiphar’s wife is the first
of the five, to which he adds the case of
Bellerophon, Peleus, and Hippolytus (Hor.
C. iii. 7), and a fifth, a story from Roman
History, probably more true than the three
just mentioned, contained in Plutarch’s
Parallels of Greek and Roman History.

‘⁴ Mulier saevissima tunc est

Quum stimulos odio pudor admovet.'’
(Juvenal, Sat. x. v. 328.)

26. toqatis] Men did not wear the toga
or the calcei in the bathS, and if these men
had worn them there, they would have been
observed. Besides, the baths were well
lighted, and men would be seen, unless they
retired into some inner part.—‘ conjicere:'
‘ coicere ⁷ P. G.

quadrantaria] There is a story in Plu-
tarch's Life of Cicero (c. 29) that Clodia
had the name because one of her lovers sent-
her some copper coin in a purse instead of
silver. The ‘quadrans' was the sum paid
by the poor for a bath.

‘⁴ dum tu quadrante lavatum
Rex ibis.”
