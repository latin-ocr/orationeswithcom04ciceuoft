rium extra ordinem non dedi.-At hominem dignum mittent.—

Num P. Servilio digniorem?

At eum quidem civitas non habet.

Quod ergo ipse nemini putat dandum ne a senatu quidem, id ego

unius judicio delatum comprobem?

Expedito nobis homine et

parato, patres conscripti, opus est, et eo qui imperium legitimum
habeat, qui praeterea auctoritatem, nomen, exercitum, perspectum

animum in re publica liberanda.

of yours causes even delay in punishing
Dolabella ? for when will the consul come?
Or must we wait for this, until not even a
trace of the states and cities of Asia shall be
left ?’ The other side is supposed to reply ε
‘ But they will send somebody out of their
own class ⁷ (some consular). ⁴ That,’ re-
joins Cicero ironically, ‘may be explained
to my satisfaction, who have just refused to
give an extraordinary commission to a pri-
vate person)

In place of ⁴ quo ne ' Gul. Christ writes
‘ quoad ne,' which Halm accepts3 t has
‘ quo ante,’ b ‘quo nec,‘ a ‘ quo,⁷ gi ‘ quo
ne.' Lambinus proposed ‘ an id tempus
. . . quo ne! I don’t see what we gain by
Christ’s emendation. The expression in
the text may be difficult to translate, as
many of the combinations of ‘ qui ' with the
subjunctive are ; but it is easy to under·
stand: ⁴ are we waiting until not a trace of
the states and cities of Asia shall be left ?'
But a proper translation should not neglect
the ‘ id.’

nos datis) : putat codd. et edd. ‘Velim

There are two ways of dealing with a proposal
to alter the MSS. readings. We may show
that the text is capable of a fair explana-
tion, and when that can bc done we should
decide in favour of the text, for the general
presumption is that the MSS. arc 1·ight;
and in every case where we suppose that
they are not right. we must be able to show
some reason why they are not. Or we can
begin by assuming the proposed alteration
to be right, and see whether it makes the
whole more consistent than the MSS. read-
ing. If we accept ⁴ putavi‚’ Cicero says:

Aut M. Brutus aut G. Cassius aut
Decernerem plane, sicut multa, consulem alterum am-

‘ What I myself thought ought not to be
given to any man even by the senate, shall
I approve of that being conferred by a single
man’s decision ?' The single man is the
consul Pansa, as the chapter shows; for
though Cicero has said ⁴ mittent,' he means
to say that Pansa, who is at Rome, may
commission some person to go out against
Dolabella, and the person must be named
by Pansa alone, if there was to be no delay
in sending somebody out, for Hirtius was
before Mutina (Quod quidem . . . nihil sus-
picatur). But ‘ipsc’ and ‘ego’ seem to
show that two persons are put in oppositi0n‚
Cicero himself and anothcr; and I think
Cicero would not have said ‘ ipse putavi ¹ if
he were speaking of himself, and then added
⁴ id ego.’ If we take the reading ⁴ ipsc
putat‚’ the reading of the MSS.. ‘ipse ' re-
fers to Servilius, as Manutius observes, and
this is more conformable to the use of ‘ ipse‚’
‘ego’ being in the other member of the
sentence, than to suppose ‘ipse ' to mean
Cicero. There seems no difficulty in assign-
ing this opinion to Servilius, for Cicero has
said (c. 9) : “ Etsi quis potest refragari non
modo non petenti, verum etiam recusanti.”
The man who is said to refusc the commis-
sion himself may very well be supposed to
think that it ought not to be given to any
other person. not even by the senate; and
if Servilius thought that the senate should
not make such an appointment, Cicero could
properly ask if he himself could approve of
such appointment when made by a single.
man, the consul. 1 think that the MSS.
reading may bc satisfactorily explained, and
that it presents less difficulty than the pro-
posed alteration.

corrupt. Halm writes ‘multa in consuli-
