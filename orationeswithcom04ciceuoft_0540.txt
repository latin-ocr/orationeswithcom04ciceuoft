518 ORAT. PHILIPPIGARUM LIBER SECUNDUS.

Deiotaro, populi Romani amicissimo, decretum in Capitolio fixum,
quo proposito nemo erat qui in ipso dolore risum posset continere.
Quis enim cuiquam inimicior quam Deiotaro Caesar? aeque atque
huic ordini, ut equestri, ut Massiliensibus, ut omnibus, quibus rem
publicam populi Romani caram esse sentiebat. Igitur a quo vivo
nec praesens nec absens quidquam aequi boni impetravit, apud mor-
tuum factus est gratiosus. Compellarat hospitem praesens, com-
putarat, pecuniam imperarat, in ejus tetrarchia unum ex Graecis
comitibus suis collocarat: Armeniam abstulerat a senatu datam.
Haec vivus eripuit, reddit mortuus. At quibus verbis? Modo
aequum sibi videri, modo non iniquum. Mira verborum complexio.
At ille numquam, semper enim absenti adfui Deiotaro, quidquam
sibi quod nos pro illo postularemus aequum dixit videri. Syn·-
grapha sestertii centies per legatos, viros bonos, sed timidos et im*
peritos, sine nostra, sine reliquorum hospitum regis sententia facta
in gynaeceo est, quo in loco plurimae res venierunt et veneunt.
Qua ex syngrapha quid sis acturus meditere censeo. Rex enim
ipse sua sponte, nullis commentariis Caesaris, simul atque audivit
ejus interit-um, suo Marte res suas recuperavit. Sciebat homo
sapiens jus semper hoc fuisse, ut quae tyranni eripuissent, ea tyran-
nis interfectis ii quibus erepta essent recuperarent. Nemo igitur
jureconsultus, ne iste quidem, qui tibi uni est jureconsultus, per
quem haec agis, ex ista syngrapha deberi dicit pro iis rebus, quae

reye Deiotaro] See the Introd. to that

oration—‘Massiliensibus :' aster Caesar had

defeated Pompeius' legati in Spain (Rc.

49), Massilia, which had opposed him on

is way to Spain, surrendered.

quidquam aequi bom‘] ‘ aequum, bonum '
was a technical formula. Pro Caecina, c.
33, and the note.

compellarat] Caesar when he was in Ga-
latia had addressed Deiotarus about money
matters. This skilful usurper was always
looking after money, without which war
cannot be carried on. He had come to a
reckoning (computarat). V. has ‘impe-
trarat,’ which Halm accepts. He spoiled
the king, says Cicero (De Divin. ii. c. 37) :
‘⁴ spoliatum reliquit et hospitem et regem.'’
He took from him the tetrarchy of the
Trocmi, and gave the Less Armenia to
Ariobarzanes (p. 423).

complexio] A confusion of words. The
false decretum was absurd ; it used the terms
⁴ aequum ’ and ‘ non iniquum.’—‘ absenti
adfui :⁷ supported his case (Pro Deiotaro).

Synyrapha] A writing, an obligation.
He says ‘ sestertii centies ;' for so this word

‘sestertium ’ is used. There is a note on
‘syngrapha' (Verr. ii. l. c. 363 Vol. i.).
The writing was made in Fulvia’s apart-
ments (‘ in gynaece0‚’ the Greek γυναικω-
νῖτις). Compare Ad Att. xiv. 12. In revo-
lutions there are always women who play a
part, and get hold of money.

jureconsultus] After Caesar's death old
Deiotarus took possession of what he had
lost. Cicero argues that as Deiotarus had
got what the writing gave him, Antonius
could not sue upon it. His legal argument
is merely a joke. There were better rea-
sons why Antonius could not sue on such
an agreement. It is very true that Anto-
nius could not sell to a man what belonged
to him. This was a rule of Roman law and
of common sense, that if a man happened
to sell something which really belonged
to the buyer, it was no sale. But even if
the bargain of Antonius and Deiotarus held
good, the transaction was not a sale, for
Antonius had nothing to sell to Deiotarus.
We do not know who was Antonius’ lawyer-
It may be the famous Sex. Clodius, whom
he had recalled from exile (Phil. i. c. 1).
