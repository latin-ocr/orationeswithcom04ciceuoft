524 ORAT. PHILIPPICARUM LIBER SECUNDUS.

alter gladiorum est princeps, alter poculorum. Quid ego illas
istius minas contumeliasque commemorem, quibus invectus· cst
in Sidicinos, vexavit Puteolanos, quod C. Cassium et Brutos
patronos adoptassent? magno quidem studio, judicio, benevo-
lentia, caritate; non ut te et Basilum, vi et armis, et alios vestri
similes, quos clientes nemo habere velit, non modo illorum cliens
esse. XLII, Interea dum tu abes, qui dies ille collegae tui fuit,
quum illud quod tu venerari solebas bustum in foro evertit? Qua
re tibi nuntiata, ut constabat inter eos qui una fuerunt, concidisti.
Quid evenerit postea nescio. Metum credo valuisse et arma. Col-
legam quidem de caelo detraxisti, effecistique, non tu quidem etiam
nunc, ut similis tui, sed certe ut dissimilis esset sui.

Qui vero inde reditus Romam, quae perturbatio totius urbis?
Memineramus Cinnam nimis potentem, Sullam postea dominantem;
modo regnantem Caesarem videramus. Erant fortasse gladii, sed
absconditi, nec ita multi. Ista vero quae et quanta barbaria est.
Agmine quadrato cum gladiis sequuntur: scutorum lecticas portari
videmus. Atque his quidem jam inveteratis, patres conscripti,
consuetudine obduruimus. Kalendis Juniis quum in senatum, ut
erat constitutum, venire vellemus, metu perterriti repente diffugimus.
At iste qui senatu non egeret, neque desideravit quemquam, et
potius discessu nostro laetatus est, statimque illa mirabilia facinora
effecit. Qui chirographa Caesaris defendisset lucri sui caussa, is
leges Caesaris easque praeclaras, ut rem publicam concutere pos-
Ad Att. xiv. 6).

Cinnam] Cicero had certainly seen the
man, though he does not say 50, for Cicero

Atticus (xvi. ll), in which there are several
allusions to this speech, Cicero says, ‘¹ Anag-
nini sunt Mustela ταξιάρχης et Laco qui

plurimum bibit.'’ Manutius suggested that
the names in this passage of the oration are
a gloss, because they were not in Atticus’
copy of the speech, or he would not have
asked, and Cicero would not have said, who
they were. But Halm suggests that the
names may have been added to the speech,
because Atticus had suggested it.

patronos] It was usual for these Italian
towns to choose Patroni at Rome. Cicero
was Patronus of Capua (Pro Sestio, c. 4,
and In Cat. iv. c. ll, and the note).

42. bustum] See Introd. and Phil. i. c.
2.—⁴ metum ι’ he does not know what
changed Dolabella; he suggests that it was
sear and the dread of Antonius’ soldiers;
but Cicero knew that Dolabella got money
from Antonius, and he says so in his letters.

Colleyam quidem] ιΙ know this, that
you have brought down your collengue from
his high elevation.' To be in heaven was
of course the highest thing ((6 in caelo esse‚”

was bom in B.c. 106, and Cinna died in
B.c. 853 and he had seen Sulla too. In his
youth he was a witness of tyrannical power
and proscription, and it was his hard fate
to perish by another proscription.—‘ erant
fortasse :' in Caesar’s reign, as he calls it.

Aymine quadrato] He approached the
city with his troops in order of battle. An
‘ agmen quadratum ' is not a square batta-
lion, but a battalion in line on the march,
and ready to fight. The term occurs in
B. G. viii. 83 Phil. v. c. 7, and xiii. e. 8.
We must supply ‘ milites ’ with ‘ sequuntur.'
The ⁴ lecticae ’ contained shields placed in
them to be concealed, and to be ready for
use.

neque desideravit] ‘ Statimque' corre-
sponds to ‘ neque desideravit ' (Halm).
‘Neque’ is sometimes followed by ‘que.'
The clause ‘et . . . laetatus est’ is inter-
posed. Halm writes ‘ sed ’ for ⁴ et.'—‘ leges
Caesaris . . ‚numerum annorum :' Phil. i. c: 8.
