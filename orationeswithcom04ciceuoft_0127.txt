GAP. 12—14. 105

Non enim sibi solum cum iis, quos jam armatos contra populum
Romanum videbat, bellandum esse duxit, sed totam Galliam in
nostram ditionem esse redigendam. Itaque cum acerrimis natio-
nibus et maximis Germanorum et Helvetiorum praeliis felicissime
decertavit; ceteras conterruit, compulit, domuit, imperio populi
Romani parere assuefecit, et quas regiones quasque gentes nullae
nobis antea litterae, nulla vox, nulla fama notas fecerat, has noster
imperator nosterque exercitus et populi Romani arma peragrarunt.
Semitam tantum Galliae tenebamus antea, patres conscripti;
ceterae partes a gentibus aut inimicis huic imperio aut infidis aut
incognitis aut certe immanibus et barbaris et bellicosis tenebantur;
quas nationes nemo umquam fuit quin frangi domarique cuperet;
nemo sapienter de re publica nostra cogitavit jam inde a principio
hujus imperii, quin Galliam maxime timendam huic imperio putaret ς
sed propter vim ac multitudinem gentium illarum numquam est
antea cum omnibus dimicatum. Restitimus semper lacessiti. Nunc
denique est perfectum ut imperii nostri terrarumque illarum idem
esset extremum. XIV. Alpibus Italiam munierat antea natura non

Cicero knew this or whether he collected it numine! He gives to what he calls ‘ natura ’

from what Caesar had done, one cannot tell.
He says ⁴ video fuisse! Cicero mentions
the Germani before the Helvetii, though
the Helvetii were defeated first. This is a
slight matter. Caesar’s second campaign
carried the Roman arms to the banks of the
Maas in the north. He had struck terror
into the nations whom he had not subdued,
for after the battle on the Sambre a single
legion which was sent into the Armoric
states under P. Crassus received the sub-
mission (ac. 57) of all these states (Caesar,
B. G. ii. 34). It was however not a real
submission, for Caesar had to try all his
strength against them the next year, the
year in which this speech was made.

Semitam tantum] He calls the Provincia,
the south part of France along the Mediter-
ranean, a ⁴ semita ’ or path. It was a road
into Spain for the Romans.

Galliam maoeime timendam] This is
true. The Galli were the most formidable
enemies that the Romans had to encounter.
They had settled south of the Alps at some
unknown time. and from the earliest periods
of Roman history fresh bodies from Transal-
pine Gallia invaded Italy from time to time,
as the Gaul continues to do.

14. Alpibus . . munierat] ⁴ Nature once
not without some divine power made the
Alps a defcnce to Italy! His expression is
confused, ⁴ natura non sine aliquo divino

an efficient power, not without some ⁴ divine
numen.' He expresses however in a way
the idea that the formation of the Italian
peninsula was designed and adapted to pro-
tect it against the barbarians of the north.
The three great penffisulas, which form the
south of Europe, are protected by their
position and their mountain barriers against
invasions from the north. Such is thov
character of the continent of Europe north
of the three peninsulas, and its connection
with respect to the great mass of Asia, and
such were the habits of the people who in-
habited the centre and north of Europe,
that there was no rest3 one nation was
pressing on another, the German on the
Gaul, sometimes the Gaul on the German,
and the German in his turn was harassed
by his neighbours on the east. Every
movement in the great plain country of
Europe and Asia disturbed not only those
who were nearest to it, but even those who
were remote. In Cicero’s time the land was
not even appropriated to private use in Ger-
many. or in a large part of it. Men were

Gallia was further advunced in civilizution
