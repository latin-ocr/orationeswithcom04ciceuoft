xiii. c. 2. It seems that he was Praetor in
B.c. 43, and perhaps one of the two who
are spoken of in Phil. xii. 0. 8. Α5 110 was
with Antonius he was not acting as Praetor
urbanus (re certe noluit). Halm says that
Mommsen proposes to write ‘re certare'
for ‘ re certe 3’ but he does not say why the
change is proposed.

Bestiam] L. Calpurnius Piso Bestia,
the man whom Cicero once defended (13.0.
56) on a charge of Ambitus at the praeto-
rian Comitia (Ad Q. Fr. ii. 3, 6). Ηο 15
3111111οἀ 10 111 1110 oration Pro Sulla (c. 10,
and the note), as it is supposed. Bestia
was convicted notwithstanding Cicero's de-
fence, and went into exile3 but he had been
recalled.

Alter Caesar Vopiscus]
‘ a second Caesar Vopiscus,' a far fetched
allusion, but we may assume that Cicero's
hearers were familiar with Roman history.
C. Julius Caesar Strabo Vopiscus had some
merit as an orator (Cicero, Brutus, c. 48).
He was Aedilis curulis in B.c. 90. In 13.c.
88 he wished to be made consul, though he
had not been Praetor, and this too in spite
of the Lex Villia Annalis. The Tr. pl. P.
Antlstius and P. Sulpicius Rufus resisted
Vopiscus’ attempt, and the quarrel came to
blows.
when Cinna and Marius got possession of
Rome, for Vopiscus was of Sulla’s faction

He calls Bestia

Vopiscus perished in the next year, . .

(Brutus, c. 89; De Oratore, iii. 3). This
Caesar is one of the speakers in the De
Oratore (ii. 3), where we learn that he was
a brother of Q. Catulus (frater uterinus).—
‘ solvatur legibus :' he alludes to the Vinia
Annalis. See the Index.

sexta palma] A sixth acquittal is a
sixth victory, and that is not usual even
in a gladiator. “ Urbana,'' says Manutius,
‘⁴ quia nunc abest, sed in urbem si redierit,
accusabitur ;'' but Cicero alludes to Bestia’s
conviction, B.c. 56.

illos . . . . irritas] Manutius incorrectly
says that he was convicted under the Lex
Pompeia. In ⁴ res judicatas‚’ the ¹ verdicts
of the Judices,' Cicero alludes to those who
had been condemned under the Lex Pom-
peia (de vi) having been restored, except
Milo (Manutius).

Sama] See Phil. viii. 3. He was once
a ‘castrorum metator' (Phil. xiv. c. 4).
This is said to be the earliest passage in
which a ‘ castrorum metator,’ an officer who
marked out the ground for encampment, is
mentioned. In the time of Polybius (vi.
41) 11115 was done by a tribune and cen-
turions (comp. Caesar, B. G. ii. 17: “ ex-
ploratores centurionesque praemittit qui
locum idoneum castris deligant⁷').—-· nunc'
