IN L. CALPURNIUM PISONEM

ORATIO.

INTRODUCTION.

Tms oration was delivered in the second consulship of Cn. Pompeius
Magnus, and in the second consulship of Μ. Licinius Crassus (nc. 55),
a few days before the exhibition of the Ludi by Pompeius at the dedica-
tion of his theatre (c. 27). Fenestella placed this among the orations
which Cicero delivered in the consulship of L. Domitius and Appius
Claudius (13.0. 54). But Piso returned from his province of Macedonia
in the second consulship of Pompeius and Crassus (cc. 35. 40), and Ga-
binius returned in the consulship of Domitius and Appius. The oration
shows that it was delivered before Gabinius’ return from his province of
Syria. It is also more natural for Piso to have made an attack on Cicero
immediately after his return, and to have answered the oration (De
Prov. Cons.)‚ which had caused his recall, than to have waited a whole
year before doing it. Cicero answered Piso's attack in this oration.

L. Calpurnius Piso was the son of L. Calpurnius Piso Caesoninus and
his wife Calventia, whose father Cicero calls a Gaul. The son was born
in Bo. 101, and was accordingly five years younger than Cicero. Piso
was praetor probably iu Be. 61, and the next year he had the adminis—
tration of some province, the name of which we do not know. In B.C.
59 he was prosecuted by P. Clodius for Repetundae, but he got an ac-
quittal by throwing himself at the feet of the judices, as Valerius Maxi-
mus (viii. 1, 6) tells the story. In this same year the consul C. Julius
Caesar married Calpurnia, Piso’s daughter. Thr-ough this alliance and
the help of Cn. Pompeius, who married Caesar's daughter Julia in the
same year, Piso, with A. Gabinius for his colleague, was elected consul
for the year B.0. 58. Caesar’s marriage with Piso's daughter shows
that Caesar did not think so meanly of the man as Cicero pretends to
