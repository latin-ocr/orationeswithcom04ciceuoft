OAP. 7—9. 1 69

Eripis lacrimas, non consolando, sed minando. Quod si vestem
non publico consilio patres conscripti, sed privato officio aut miseri-
cordia mutavissent, tamen id his non licere per interdicta crudeli-
tatis tuae potestatis erat non ferendae: quum vero id senatus
frequens censuisset, et omnes ordines reliqui jam ante fecissent,
tu ex tenebricosa popina consul extractus cum illa saltatrice tonsa
senatum populi Romani occasum atque interitum rei publicae
lugere vetuisti.

IX. At quaerebat etiam paullo ante de me, quid suo mihi
opus fuisset auxilio, cur non meis inimicis meis copiis restitissem.
Quasi vero non modo eg0, qui multis saepe auxilio fuerim, sed
quisquam tam inops fuerit umquam, qui isto non modo propug-
natore tutiorem se, sed advocato aut adstipulatore paratiorem
fore putaret. Ego istius pecudis ac putidae carnis consilio scilieet
aut praesidio niti volebam? ab hoe ejecto cadavere quidquam mihi
aut opis, aut ornamenti expetebam? Consulem ego tum require-

saltatrice tonsa] This is Gabinius.
There are some remarks elsewhere about
dancing (Vol. iii. Index, Dancing). The
meaning of ⁴ saltatrix’ may easily be con-
jectured. It contains one of Cicero’s foul
insinuations. But why is Gabinius called
‘tonsa,’ when he is described in another
place as “ unguentis affluens, calamistrata
coma'' (Pro Sestio, c. 8, and the note),
and in this oration (c. 11), “erant illi

paraging sense (La Fontaine, Fables, i. 3),
a stupid sellom

Lambinus approved of the conjecture of
P. Faber Tolosanus, who would write
⁴ canis' for ‘ camis! But the Tolosanus
missed the mark. The abuse is as coarse
as it can be; but after Cicero has called
him ‘rotten flesh‚' he appropriately adds
‘ejectum cadaver.' He was first rotten;
and then he is a dead carcase, cast out to
be buried like an ass. Hotmann thinks
that ‘ejectum cadaver' is a body cast up
by the waves. Other critics saw the meau-
ing, aud Horace (Sat. i. 8, v. 8) can ex-

compti capilli, et madentes cincinnorum
fimbriae ?” Abrami suggests ¹ intonsa ’ as
one solution of the difficulty. But if Gabi-
nius made himself like a woman, he must

shave his beard. Do we expect to find
Cicero consistent in his abuse? He ridi-
culed the man’s curled hair, well smeared
with oil, when that suited the occasion.
When he wishes to make a woman of him,
he must give him the appearance of a
woman, and shave his heard.

9. At quaerebat] ‘Atque quaerebat‚’
Halm.--‘ fuerim :' ‘ T. fuissem codd. rell!
(Halm.)—-‘ adstipulatore τ’ ‘stipulatore,' S.
Halm refers to Lachmann's note on Gaius
(iii. 110). Lachmann refers to Festus (sub
voce, Reus stipulando); to Cicero, Pro
Quintio, c. 18 (aud the note, where the
passage of Gaius, iii. 110, is quoted); and
to this passage in the Piso. ‘ Adstipu-
lator ’ is the proper word here.

putidae caruis] lle calls him ‘pecus.'
The Declamator, who took the pains to
write some orations in Cicero’s name, calls
Clodius ⁴ pecus et hellua.' The French had
the word 'pecore' once in use in a dis-

plain it:

“ Huc prius angustis ejecta cadavera cellis
Conservus vili portanda locabat in arca.'’

requirebam] C. ‘quaerebam' T., Halm.
‘⁴ Requirere consulem est eum ‹luam-ere qui
antea fuerit quemque propterea sibi deberi
quis putet; sed talem nondum in Pisone
invenerat Cicero. Quaerebam consulem.
i. e. opus mihi erat consule. Cf. Verr. iii.
62 (ii. 3. 62) '⁹ (Bake, quoted by llalm).
But Cicero might reasonably expect to funi
that a consul was a consul. lle (lid expect
it, and did not find it. The passage in the
Verrine orations is this2 “ non quam-o ju-
dices Cassianos ; veterem judiciorum severi-
tatem non requiro.'' Either word might ‹11›
here; but ‘requirebam' seems the appro-
priate word. Halm adds that ⁸ quiwrvbum'
is confirmed by a passage in Isidorus
(Origg. ii. 30. 4), who quotes this passagi-
thus: ‘⁴ Consulem, inquam, quswrebam (sic
