INTRODUOTION. 445

spite of the efforts of the nobility and of the rival candidates, Cicero
was elected consul with O. Antonius for his colleague, Β.6. 641.

In the year B.c. 63, the year of 1118 consulship, Cicero showed more
steady purpose and resolution than at any other period of his politica]
life. He had a dishonest colleague to manage, who was suspected, and
probably with good reason, of being implicated in Catilina's revolutionary
designs3 and he resisted C. Caesar’s intrigues‚ who was secking for·
popularity as the wayuto power. By bringing about a closer union be-
tween the equestrian class, the monied men in the state, and the senate,
116 strengthened the aristocratical against the deinocratical party, demo-
cratical only in name, for the heads of this party only flattered the
people in order to gain their own ends. He successfully opposed the
Agraria Lex of the tribune Rullus (De Lege Agraria, i. ii. iii., Vol. ii.)‚
and in this 116 acted with the Nobiles. But Caesar in his consulship
(Be. 59) effected part of what Rullus proposed, and 116 did it in spite
of Cicero and his party. In Cicero’s consulship L. Catilina, with his
insolvent friends, made a desperate attempt to seize power, and enrich
themselves by a revolution. The consul Cicero detected their designs,
and prevailed on the senate to put to death the conspirators whom 116
had seized (In Catilinam, i. ii. iii. iv., Vol. iii.). This was au irregular
proceeding, for the conspirators were only examined before the senate,
which was not a court for the trial of criminals. Cicero was the execu-
tioner of the senate’s judgment, and 1118 6116111168 soon punished him for
this service to the state.

In 1395 60 Ο. Caesar was elected consul, and in Β.6. 59, 1116 year of
his office, the intrigues began which ended in Cicero leaving Rome.
Caesar had made advances to Cicero, whose tongue would have been
useful to him at home during his Gallie campaign; but his advances
were not accepted. If Cicero could 1101 be gained over to Caesar's
party, the next thing was to remove him from Rome. Accordingly P. χ
Clodius, who owed Cicero a grudge for having given evidence against
him in the affair of the Bona Dea, and for many a biting sarcasm, was)
adopted into a plebeian family, with the aid of Caesar and Pompeius 111
order to qualify Clodius to bc elected a Tribunus plebis. Clodius was
elected, and entered on his office on the ]Oth of December, B.C. 59,
before Caesar had laid down his consular office. In the next year Clo-
dius made an indirect attack 011 Cicero by a Rogatio to this effect, that
whoever had put to death a Roman citizen without trial and condemna-
tion, should. be liablc to the interdict of 111-6 and water. Though Cicero
was not mentioned in the Rogatio 116 knew what it meant, and hc acted
as if 116 were a guilty man. After endeavouring to move tho compassion
of the people, instead of relying 011 1118 services to the state, and appeni-
