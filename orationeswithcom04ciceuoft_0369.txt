Una . . . simul] Charisius, p. 197:
‘⁴ Una locum, simul vero spatium designat:
recteque itaque dicimus: simul consules
suerunt, una ambulabant” (Halm).

testamentum . . . obsiynari] See Pro
Cluentio, c. 13, and the note. On 'palam
fecerat' Halm quotes Ulpian (Dig. 28. 1.
21); “ Heredes palam ita ut exaudiri pos-
sint nuncupandi sunt. Licebit ergo testanti
vel nuncupare heredes vel scribere, sed si
nuncupat palam debet. Quid est palam?
Non utique in publicum, sed ut exaudiri
possit, exaudiri autem non ab omnibus,
sed a testibus3 et si plures fuerint testes
adhibiti, sufficit solemnem numerum ex-
audire.’' Ulpiau in this passage informs
us that a testament might be made either
orally, what we call a nuncupative will,
or in writing. The ‘nuncupatio’ in Gaius
(ii. 104), however, simply means the tes-
tator’s general acknowledgment of the
written testament as his testament. But
written wills were more common. Cicero
means that Cyrus had named his ⁴ heredes'
to the witnesses, and made a written will
too. It was not necessary that the wit-
nesses to a Roman will should know what
was in it, nor is it necessary in an English
will or testament. A novel of Theodosius,
Λα). 439, De Testamentis, shows that the
practice had been changed, and it bad be-
come the rule that the witnesses should
know what was in the will; a rule which
would prevent many persons from making
a will now, as it did then. The novel of
Theodosius brought back the old rule.

Cicero was both a witness to Cyrus' will
and ‘ heres scriptus! The old Roman law
had some limitations asto the capacity of
witnesses (Gaius. ii. 105), but it did not ex-
clude all ‘heredes ’ froin being witnesses.
This however was changed: ‘¹ Sed neque
heres scriptus neque is qui in potestate ejus
est neque pater ejus qui habet eum in po-

testate neque fratres qui in ejusdem patris
potestate sunt, testes adhiberi possunt, quia
totum hoc negotium, quod agitur testamenti
ordinandi gratia, creditur hodie inter here-
dem et testatorem agi ⁷' (Justin. Instit. ii.
lo‚§ 10). This is explained by the cor-
responding passage in Gaius (ii. 105):
‘⁴ quia . . . totum hoc negotium, quod agitur
testamenti ordinandi gratia creditur inter
familiae emptorem agi et testatorem.'' Iu
Gaius' time either the ‘ heres' or the le-
gatee (legatarius) could be a witness; but
Gaius adds (ii. 108) 2 “sed tamen quod ad
heredem pertinet quique in ejus potestate
est cujusve is in potestate erit, minime hoc
jure uti debemus.'’ As the ⁴ familiae emp-
tor ’ could not in the old time be a witness,
and as in the praetorian testament the
‘ familiae emptor ¹ was not used, so it bc-
came the mle, and it was a consistent rulo,
to apply to the ⁴ heres ’ what had formerly
applied to the ‘ familiae emptor.' The
English law declares that gifts made by a
will to attesting witnesses or their wives
or husbands are void.

hora decima] This agrees with the time
named in c. lo. Cicero does not directly
say that Cyrus died the day before. lle
merely says that Clodius left him dying.
Yet he wishes us to infer that. he did «he
the day before. Halm wishes to know why
the circumstance of the will being made
‘palam' rendered any hurry on Clodiu<
part unnecessary ? 1f this is Cicero's
meaning,1 suppose he means to say that
Clodius knew that he was ¹ heres,' and it'
he had not known it, he might have hurried
to Rome to learn what Cyrus haddone with
his property. But he did know it. nml
therefore there was no reason for this hasty
return.

19. Aqe, sil ila sac-lum] Lot it bv -ιε
they say, that the inesseiiger did take to
Clodius the news of Cyrus' death.
