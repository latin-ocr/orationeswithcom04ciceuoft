patria, fortunae. Salvum tu me esse cupisti : hic fecit etiam ut esse,

possem.

Distineor tamen et divellor dolore, et in caussa dispari

offendi te a me doleo ; sed me dius fidius multo citius meam salutem
pro te abjecero quam Cn. Plancii salutem tradidero contentioni

tuae.

Etenim, judices, quum omnibus virtutibus nie affectum esse

cupio, tum nihil est quod malim quam me et gratum esse et videri.
Haec est enini una virtus non solum maxima, sed etiam mater vir-

tutum omnium reliquarum.

vs of more weight, there is no evidence at
111 to support the opinion. It is however
m opinion that has been expressed by
avriters and eommentators, but I cannot
ind the least evidence to support it.

in caussa dispari] ‘ In a case where the
lisparity is so great.y The disparity is this:
Laterensis had little to gain by sueceeding,
ind Plancius would lose everything by con-
iiction (Wunder). Manutius explains it
ihus: “Tu enim perdere Plancium vis,
ego conservare.” But the other is the
neaning.

virtutibus me] ‘me virtutibus,’ E. 3 and
Wunder would have kept this order if
›ther MSS. were in favour of it. It re-
luires only a little attention to see what
'ariety in the order of words the Latin
anguage admits. Perhaps of all languages
he Latin is least restricted in the arrange-
nent of the words; and though our own
anguage allows much less liberty in this
espect, because the relation of the words
o one another is determined nearly alto-
:ether by the arrangement, still the differ-
nce between a good and a bad writer is
hown by the order of his words, as much
s by the selection of them. In Latin it is
,llowed to interpose one word or more be-
ween an adjective and its noun, and ⁴ me '
an be placed between ⁸ omnibus ’ and ‘ vir-
utibus ς’ and perhaps it should stand so in
his passage. There are no rules for such
ases. They are matters of taste and inten-
ion. They belong to the domain of art,
,nd the rules of art, so far as rules can be
nade, are only the formal expression of a
udgment founded on something which is
iot reducible to rule.

qratum esse] ‘et csse gratum’ T. E.
laiter. Cicero makes gratitude the founda-
ion of all virtues. There is some truth in
ilS remark, at least so far as this, that iu-
:ratitude excludes the possibility os any
irtue. A man who has received kiudness
rom another and repays it by injury or even
»y neglect is a man devoid of all gooducss.
f law could rcach the offence of such u
nan, he would be rightly visited with its

VOL. lv·

Quid est pietas nisi voluntas grata in

extreme penalties. But ingratitude is a
crime which eludes judicial investigation,
and is one of the instances which show the
narrow limits within which law can operate.
The Romans indeed did punish ungrateful
frecdmen‚ but it is not easy to see how the
fact of ingratitude could be proved, unless
by some act which deserved punishment
even if done by another. A passage in Ta·
citus (Annal. xiii. 26) speaks of the patro-
nus banishing the freedman who had done
him wrong, and to the limit of one hundred
miles from the city. Under the empire it
is certain that the libertus was punishahle
for certain acts, which were comprehcnded
under the general notion of ingratitudo,
though some of the acts enumerated in the
Digest (37. 14. l) are such as would have
been punishable if done by any person.
pieta-9] See Index, Vol. ii.-—‘ qui patriae
beneficia :' the Patria has given us birth,
taken care of us, and brought us up, and so
we are bound to obey it, as Socrates says
in the Crito (c. 12), and to be grattful, as
Cicero says here, for what the Patria has
done for us. It is a crime, says Socrates
to do violence either to a father or mother,
and still greater to do violence to the Patria ;
the Patria being the parent, and the 111115101-
of every man, and of all his ancestors. The
gratitude to the Patria, and absolute obe-
dience are, however, founded on the assump-
tion of the relation of parent and child be-
tween the Patria and the citizcns; and So-
crates makes the duty of the child depend
on the previous condition of the parental
care of the Patria about the child's nurture
and education. If the Patria has not dono
her part first, the obcdieneeot‘the child and
his gratitude arc not due. This conclusion
he could not avoid, nor would he have at-
tempted to evade it. But with us the Patria
enforces obedience to its rules without ask-
ing whether it has brought up the child as
it ought to do. The l'latonic idea of 11 stato
is an organized unity to which every indi·
vidual belongs as a member, and is bound
to act in conforniity to the organis-ni. 'riw
