satis est ab hominibus virtutis ignaris gratiam bene merentibus non
referri? etiam in 005, qui omnes suas ouras in rei publicae salute de-
figunt, crimen invidiaque quaeretur? Scitis enim per 1105 dies creber-
rimum fuisse sermonem, me Parilibus, qui dies hodie est, cum fasci-
bus descensurum. In aliquem eredo 1100 gladiatorem aut latronem
aut Catilinam esse confictum, non 111 eum. quine quid tale 111 re

crimen invidiaque quaeram] This is
what Faernus proposed. It may not be

Kal. Mai, or the 20111 of April.

Ferrarius proposed to read ‘postridie

exactly what Cicero wrote, but it is near
enough to give us his meaning. Some
MSS. have‘impetus' before* crimen, 'but
it- 15 corrupt. It may represent‘ impieta-
tisss as Halm suggests. Cicero says qui-
bus auspiciis istos l'asees augur 101111( rtm >⁷
It. would have been an 1101 of irreligion as
well as a usurpation.

Parilibus] t, Halm. This reading re-
moves the difficulty caused by the reading
‘ per idus quintiles ’a b iv. Halm observes
that it is confirmed by Pseudo—Cornutus ad
Pers. Sat. i. 72, p. 264, ed. Iahnii: “Si
Palilia dicit, diem dicit sacram in honorem
Iliae quae peperit. Remum et Romulum,
quorum mentionem sacrificiorum Cicero 111
Philippicis sic commemorat ;'’ but the pas-
sage is lost. A passage in the spurious
letters of s'icero to Brutus (i 3) states that
it was the Χ11.Κ111.Μ«1115 xxv-lun C· icero was
taken to the Capit01;mnl th( next d 11 or
xl. Kal. Μ111115(215101“ Amil), is the Palilia,
or Parilia, the birthday of home. ’111151
spurious letter may be good authority t'or
the date, for, like the others, it hus been
patched up out ot' Cicero's orations and
letters. It agrees with what is said in this
oration if we read ⁴ l'nrilihus,’ for here he
says that he 15 addressing the senato 011 1110
Parilia, and that he had been taken to the
Capitol the day before. whieh would be ΧΠ.

Palilia‚' or what he preferred, ‘pridie Vinalia)
The Vinalia were on the lx. Kal. Mai. or the
23rd of April ; and aceordinely this speech
would be delivered 011 the 221111 ot' April.

fascibus descensurum] 1115 0110111105 had
spread a report that 110 was going to 1155111110
1110 “ fasces: or assume authority ς but what
was supposed to be the title of his office it
is not said. However‚ says he, it was said
that he would come down from his residence
with the symbols ot' power.

6. 1100 triduo vel qnalriclao] The writer
of the elumsy letter to Brutus (i. 3) seems
to have laid hold of these words for his pur-
pose. See, 0. 4. 11111111 writes ⁸ quadriduo!

viribus] a b i, ‘iuris ' or ⁵ uiris' t. llalm
has ⁴ partihus‚' a conjecture of Klotz. Many
other conjectures have been made, but the.
textis as good as any ot* them. Muretus’
proposed reading, ‘euriam suis potius quam
lei publieae.’ certainly gives us Cieero's
meaning. and 15· the best thing to put in the
text. it' we are not content with ⁴ viribus
potius suis.’ The Curia may 110, 1110 Pom-
peiana in which Caesar was killed. as Fer-
rarius aud Muretus suggest. Manutius
guesses that. it may be the¹ llostilin. which
was burnt when Clodius* body was hnrnt ;
and in consequence. of their share in this
1101, Τ. Plancus, Q. Pompeius, and Sex.
Clodius were obliged to leuve Romo.
