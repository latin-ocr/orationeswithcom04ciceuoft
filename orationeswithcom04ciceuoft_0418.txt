396 ORAT. PRO M. MARCELLO

et saluti consulas, omnesque tibi,—-ut pro aliis etiam loquar quod
de me ipse sentio,——-quoniam subesse aliquid putas quod cavendum
sit, non modo excubias et custodias, sed etiam laterum nostrorum
oppositus et corporum pollicemur.

XI. Sed ut unde est orsa, in eodem terminetur oratio, maximas
tibi omnes gratias agimus, O. Caesar, majores etiam habemus.
Nam omnes idem sentiunt, quod ex omni'iim precibus et lacrimis
sentire potuisti : sed quia non est omnibus stantibus necesse dicere,
ame certe dici volunt, cui necesse est quodammodo 3 et quod fieri
decet M. Marcello 'a te huic ordini populoque Romano et rei
publicae reddito fieri id intelligo3 nam laetari omnes non de unius
solum, sed de communi [omnium] salute sentio. Quod autem sum-
mae benevolentiae est, quae mea erga illum omnibus semper nota
fuit, ut vix G. Marcello optimo et amantissimo fratri, praeter eum

ll. Sed ut, δρᾷ] He comes back to
the business, which has been interrupted
by chapters 7—10. If the greater part of

again with the civil wars, ‘diversae vo—
luntates z’ tells us that the wars are ended,
that a mild and merciful conqueror has

these four chapters were struck out, the
oration would be the better for it. The
suspicion of Caesar and his sear of secret
enemies is the text that he begins with
(c. 7), but we cannot tell if the orator had
any reason for touching on this subject,
unless we knew what Caesar had said.
After telling Caesar that he had no cause
for sear, he shows how much mischief the
civil wars had left him to repair (c. 8); and
then he passes to Caesar's declaration that
he had lived long enough to satisfy either
nature, whatever he means by nature, or
glory. It might be said that Caesar's
alleged fears and his declaration are not
consistent3 but a judgment on this matter
is hardly possible as we do not know what
Caesar had said. He may have expressed
an opinion that there were men who sought
his life, and he may also have said, that he
cared not for them and had lived long
enough. Having got upon the subject of
glory, the orator is warlned by a favourite
topic, and in the remainder of c. 8, and in
c. 9, he points out to Caesar the way of
securing his glory and an imperishable
name. If Caesar does not finish the last
act of life well, posterity may attribute his
great acts to fate, and think that he had
not wisdom enough to establish the tran-
quillity and happiness of his country.

All this is very declamatory, and if part of
it is genuine, I do not believe that the
whole is. But I cannot view c. 10 as any
thing but an idle addition. He begins

secured his victory, and that Caesar need
sear no enemies; all which we have had be-
fore. He concludes, as he had concluded
before, that every man's safety depends on
Caesar’s life, which he begs him to be
careful to protect; and since he still has
some sear he ends with ⁴ non modo excubias
et custodias, sed etiam laterum nostrorum
oppositus et corporum pollicemur! This
is certainly extravagant, and hardly con-
sistent with the letter to Sulpicius, in which
Cicero speaks of this speech. If any body
can satisfactorily explain these four chapters,
he may perhaps remove most of the doubts
about the genuineness of the speech, but
not all.

omnibus stantibus] A man of course
stood when he spoke. He says then it is
not necessary for all to stand up and speak.
Wolf thinks that there is a contradiction
between the letter to Sulpicius and the
speaker3 for in the letter he says that all
the senators had thanked Caesar except
one, while here he speaks as if he was the
only person who had thanked Caesar, and
thanked him in the name of all. Dru-
mann says that there is no contradiction.
As the senators who delivered their opi·-
nion before Cicero had expressed them-
selves more'briefly, Cicero could give the
matter this turn, that they had left him to
be the interpreter of their feehngs, and as a
reason for it he does not arrogantly men-
tion his greater eloquence, but his more
intimate connexion with Marcellus.
