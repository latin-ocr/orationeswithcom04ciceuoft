ΤΟ ΤΗΕ THIRD PHILIPPIC. 533

Tibur, and to have placed a body of cavalry before the gates of Rome,
and to have entered the city with a sufficient force to protect him.

In his Edicta he abused Caesar and taunted him with the meanness os
his origin (Phil. iii. c. 6); and he reproached Cicero with the old affair
of the Catilina conspiracy. He gave notice of a meeting of the senate
for the 24th of November, buthe (lid not come to the senate on that
day. The meeting was put off to the 2Sth of November, on which day
the senate met in the Capitol (Phil. iii. 0. 8). Cicero says in one place
(Phil. iii. c. 8) that Antonius did not come to the senate 011 the 24th,
because he was drinking. In another place (Phil. xiii. 0. 9) he speaks
of Ant-onius going to Tibur before the meeting of the senate in the
Capitol, and making a speech there. The object of the meeting on the
28th was to declare Caesar an enemy, and some ‘ consularis,’ whose name
is not mentioned, came prepared with a motion to that effect. Antonius
already knew that the Legio Martia had gone to Alba with the inten-
tion of joining Caesar, and now hearing that the Quarta had revolted,
he put off the business about Caesar and hurried through the senate
a motion to grant a ‘ supplicatio ’ to Μ. Lepidus for bringing about a
reconciliation between Sex. Pompeius, the son of Magnus, and the senate
(Phil. iii. c. 9).

Antonius went to Alba to stop the mutiny, but being received with
a shower of arrows from the walls he returned. Appian (B. C. iii. 45)
says that he then retircd to Tibur with the troops which he had with
him, and with all the stores usual when a general was going to take the
field. He may however have returned to Rome before he went to
Tibur (Phil. iii. c. 10 ; xiii. c. 9) ; for Cicero speaks of the ‘ sortitio pro-
vinciarum’ being made on an evening after the revolt of the Quarta
was known (Phil. iii. 0. 1Ο); and of Antonius addressing the people,
and telling them that he would protect the city. It is very difficult to get
out of Cicero a clear view of the movements of Antonius at this time.
However this may be, when Antonius went to Tibur he was followed by
many senators and others who attempted to bring about a reconcilia-
tion (Appian, B. C. iii. c. 46). If Appian's story is true, hc did not
leave Rome, nor advance to north Italy exactly under the circumstances
which Cicero mentions. He hurried into Cisalpine Gallia to secure the
possession of that province3 and perhaps he hoped to gain over M. Le-
pidus, and also Plancus, who was in Transalpine Gallia. Antonius left
his wife and children behind him in Rome, and he had friends there to
look after his interests and to oppone Cicero.

Antonius had got by a vote of the peoplc the province of Gallia
Cisalpina, and power to make war on D. Brutus with the Macedonian
legions, if Brutus would not give up the province. Brutus opposed to
Antonius’ claim the resolution of the senate, which had confirmed
