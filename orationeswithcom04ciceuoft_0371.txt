20. Antesundum . . . valentium] Quoted
by Gellius (i. 16), and also by Macrobius
(Sat. i. 5). Gellius remarks 11181 there is no
doubt that Cicero wrote ‘ versabatur-¹ and
not ‘versabanlw·.·’ “ quod in libris minus
accurate scriptis est : 8118 enim ratione mille
hominum, alia mille homines dicendum est.’'
⁴ Mille ’ in such cases, he says, is 8 noun
corresponding to the Greek χιλιὰς. Μ8-
crobius 1185 some remarks to the same
effect. T. E. S. and Pompeius Gramm.
quoted by Baiter have ‘ versabantur‚’ which
he also prefers. “The ‘ substructiones ’ of
Clodius,'' says Klotz, ⁸⁴ seem to be altera-
tions made on the ground for buildings,
terraccs,'’ 8ιο. Perhaps Cicero means that
Clodius had begun these great works and
had not yet got. beyond the foundations.
The rich Romans spent immense sums on
their country 11011505, parks, and ponds.
The rich must find some way of getting rid
of their money, if they have not 8 taste for
hoarding it. Resides building the Roman
could spend his money on electious and

works of art. But he wanted some of the
ways of spending which modern times sup-
ply, racing and betting. Gambling was an
amusement that might be made the means
of spending money, but modern times offer
immense advantages over ancient times for
those who have money and the wish to
spend it.

constrictus] Held fast by his wife to
prevent him getting down to fight.—‘ id
temporis' means, says 1181111, 81 511011 a
time in the year, late in the autumn, when
the days were short. Graevius explained
the words as referring to the time os the
day.

villam Pompeii] Cn. Pompeius' Albanum
was near that of Clodius'. Among the few
remains at Albano, those. in the Vina Duria
are said to belong to Pompeius' villa. awl
it is said that Domitian united the ¹ villae '
os Pompeius and Clodius. and enlargeul
them (Westplxal, Die Rom. Kampagne, p.
24). The Alsiense of Pompeius was at
Alsium (Palo) in Etruria, on the coast.
