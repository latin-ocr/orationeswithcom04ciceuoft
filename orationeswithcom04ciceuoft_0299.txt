XXXV. Sed [sunt] haec leviora ; illa vero gravia atque magna,
quod meum discessum, quem saepe defleras, nunc quasi reprehen-
dere et subaccusare voluisti. Dixisti enim non auxilium mihi, sed
me auxilio defuisse. Ego vero fateor me, quod viderim mihi aux-
ilium non deesse, idcirco me illi auxilio pepercisse. Qui enim
status, quod discrimen, quae fuerit in re publica tempestas illa, quis
nescit? Tribunicius me terror an consularis furor movit Ξ Decer-
tare mihi ferro magnum fuit cum reliquiis eorum, quos ego florentes
atque integros sine ferro viceram? Consules post hominum nie-
moriam taeterrimi atque turpissimi, sicut et illa principia et hi
recentes rerum exitus declararunt, quorum alter exercituin perdidit,
alter vendidit, emptis provinciis, a senatu, a re publica, a bonis
omnibus defecerant: qui exercitu, qui armis, qui opibus plurimum
poteraut, quum quid sentirent nesciretur, furialis illa vox, nefariis
stupris religiosis altaribus effeminata, secum et illos et consules
facere acerbissime personabat; egentes in locupletes, perditi in

bonos, servi in dominos armabantur.

35. Sed [sunt] haec] The word ‘ sunt '
seems in this place to be at variance with
Tully’s usage: see Cicero, Philipp. iii. c. 9:
⁴⁴ Sed haec leviora fortasse; illud quaeso ;”
and Phil. ii. ll: “Sed haec vetera: illud
vero recens” (Wunder).—‘meum disces-
sum :¹ the old story about his leaving Rome
in B.c. 58 to avoid his enemies (In vatin. c.
3; In Pis. c. 9, and c. 14; Pro Sestio, c.
16, &c.).—‘auxilio pepercisse :' see c. 36,
the beginning.

reliquiis] He calls his enemies a rem-
nant of Catilina's crew, whether truly or
not, we cannot say3 but he often does it
(In Pis. c. 7 and 10).—‘consules:‘ Piso
and Gabinius, consuls of the year B.c. 58,
when P. Clodius was tribune. The first
acts (principia) of their consulship are
spoken of in the oration In Pisonem, and
the recent events (recentes rerum exitus) in
the oration De Prov. Cous. The ‘alter’
who lost his army is Piso, the governor of
Macedonia3 the other ‘alter' is Gabinius,
who “regem Ptolemaeum acceptis decem
millibus talentum per vim militarem exer-
citus Romani restituisset in regnum suuni ''
(Schol. Ambros.) See Pro Rabirio Post.c‚8.

emptis provinciis] See De Prov. cons.
c. ⁴1. There are numerous passages in
which Cicero speaks ot' the two consuls bar-
gaining t'or their provinces with the tribune
P. Clodius. ‘ny buying the. provinces!
bargaining for them, ⁴ the two consuls had
deserted the senate, the State, and all good
men!

At erat mecum senatus, et

qui eoeerei'tn] This is Caesar3 and we
get rid of some little difficulty by the better
reading ‘ exercitu ’ (T. Ε.) in place of ⁴ ex-
ercitibusss However, even if we have ‘ex-
ercitibus,’ he still means Caesar's army
only, which was iu North Italy (Pro Sestio,
c. 17, 18, 19). He also alludes in the
words ¹ qui opibus ’ to M. Crassus and Cn.
Pompeius.

nefariis stupris] An allusion to the
affair of P. Clodius and the Bona. Dea (Ad
Att. i. 12; De Prov. Cons. c. 103 In Pison.
c. 39, and the Index to Vol. iii.).

et illos et consules] As the three great-
men, C. Caesar, M. Crassus, and Cn. Pom-
peius said nothing against P. Clodius, he
could say, and they allowed him to say. that
they were on his side (et illos), as well as
the two consuls. (Pro Sestio, c. 18 and la.)

At erat mecum senalus] The MSS. have
‘Aderat’ in place of ⁴ At erat;' and also
further on, ‘Aderat meeum eunetns,’ &st
Wunder has changed ‘Aderat' into ‘ At
erat ' in both places, and for sufficient rea-
sons. The sense requires the adversative
particle ⁴ At.' Resides this, ‘aderat,’ which
would mean ¹ helped nie, assisted nn& on
niy trial, or something of the kind. would
not. express the saet3 nor is there any sense.
in which we ean understand ¹ aderat.’ Wun-
der remarks that in fact he has mad«- no
change at. all, for it was usual in (iven-ms
time to write both the proposition and thc
conjunction with a d. Quintilian (i. 75:
“ illa quoque servata esta multis differentia,
