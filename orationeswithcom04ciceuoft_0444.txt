422 PRO REGE DEIOTARO.

Manlius invaded Galatia, and after severely chastising the Galli, com-
pelled these turbulent men to agree to keep within their own territory.

The Galli in Galatia mingled with the Greeks, at least their chiess
did, and the fact of the intermixture of the two raccs appears both from
the name Gallograeci, which the Romans often gave to them, and from
other evidence. Each of the three tribes had its territory; each tribe
was divided into four divisi0ns‚ named tetrarchiae3 and each tetrarchia
had its chief or tetrarches The council of the twelve tetrarchae, which
was a body of three hundred men, used to meet at Drynaemetum‚ a*
place which probablycontains the elements of Gallie names (Strabo, p.
567). Strabo says this was the old arrangement, but in his time the
power came into the hands of three chiefs, then two, and then one, who
was named Deiotarus, and he was succeeded by Amyntas3 “but the
Romans now have both this (Galatia) and all the country which was
under Amyntas, having formed it into one province (ἐπιιρχία).”

Deiotarus aided the Romans in their wars in Asia against Mithridates
(Phil. xi. c. 13); and when Cn. Pompeius was settling the affairs of
Asia after the death of Mithridates, he confirmed Deiotarus and the
other tetrarchs in their dominions, and he gave Deiotarus a considerable
tract of country east of the Halys. The hereditary tetrarchy of Deio-
tarus was the-Tolistobogii, or Tolistoboii (Strabo, p. 547). Pompeius’
arrangements in Asia were confirmed in Caesar's consulship (B.e. 59),
and through Caesar's influence3 and this was a service done to the
Galatian tetrarch which Caesar afterwards reminded him of (De Bell.
Alex. c. 68). Deiotarus afterwards received from the Roman senate
the title of King of Armenia Minor3 but not content with what he
had, he made himself tetrarch of nearly all Gallograecia, and contrary to
the rights of other tetrarchs. When Cicero was proconsul of Cilicia
(Rc. 51), Deiotarus prepared to support him with all his forces, when
Cicero was expecting an incursion of the Parthians (Ad Att. vi. 1 3 Ad
Div. xv. 4); and Cicero’s son and nephew‚ whom he bad taken with
him to Asia, were entrusted to the king's care, or to his son’s (Ad Att.
v. 17, 183 and c. 10 of this oration). In the contest between Caesar
and Pompeius Deiotarus joined Pompeius, and was with him at the
battle of Pharsalus. He and Pompeius escaped in the same vessel from
the mouth of the Peneius.

Deiotarus returning to his country found Cn. Domitius Calvinus in
possession of Asia and the adjoining provinces with a commission from
Caesar, who was then in Egypt. He prevailed on Calvinus to go against
Mithridates' son Pharnaces, who was ravaging Deiotarus’ kingdom of
Armenia Minor, and Cappadocia, the kingdom of Ariobarzanes. Cal-
vinus was helped by Deiotarus with two legions, which the tetrarch had
for some years trained and armed after Roman sasbion (De Bello Afric.
