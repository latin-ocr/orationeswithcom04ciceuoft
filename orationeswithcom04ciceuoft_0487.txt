OAP. 4—6. 465

quumque e via languerem et mihimet displicerem, misi pro amicitia,
qui hoc ei diceret. At ille vobis audientibus oum fabris se domum
meam venturum esse dixit. Nimis iracunde hoc quidem et valde
intemperanter. Cujus enim maleficii ista poena est, ut dicere in
hoc ordine auderet se publicis operis disturbaturum publice ex
senatus sententia aedificatam domuin? Quis autem umquam tanto
damno senatorem coegit, aut quid est ultra pignus aut mulctam}
Quod si scisset quam sententiam dicturus essem, remisisset aliquid
profecto de severitate cogendi. VI. An me censetis, patres con-
scripti, quod vos inviti secuti estis decreturum fuisse, ut parentalia
cum supplicationibus miscerentur, ut inexpiabiles religiones in rem
publicam inducerentur, ut decernerentur supplicationes mortuo?
nihil dico cui. Fuerit ille [L.] Brutus, qui et ipse dominatu regio
rem publicam liberavit, et ad similem virtutem et simile factum
stirpem jam prope in quingentesimum annum propagavit, adduci
tamen non possem, ut quemquam mortuum conjungerem cum im·
mortalium religione, ut cujus sepulcrum nusquam exstet ubi
parentetur, ei publice supplicetur. Ego vero eam sententiam
dixissem ut me adversus populum Romanum, si qui accidisset

publicis operis] That is, ‘fabri.' Ci-

the tribunate of Clodius, was rebuilt by
order of the senate.

ultra pigmus] A senator might be com-
pelled to attend the senate by a ‘ pignoris
capio ;' that is, a distress levied on his
goods, or by fine. Gellius xiv. 7 : ¹‘ Praeter
haee de pignore quoque capiendo disserit,
deque mulcta dicenda senatori, qui quum in
senatum venire deberet non adesset.”

6. parentalia] An annual solemnity and
feast in honour of dead kinsfolk, celebrated
in February(Cicero, De Legg. ii. c.2l ; Ovid,
Fasti, ii. v. 570). All these honours to
the dead man with ⁴ supplicationes ’ would
have been religious cercmonios (religiones)
or rather abuses of religion. which would
have been crimes before the gods, and past
all forgiveness.

may be true or not. If he did, it is not
very likely that they would exist five
hundred years after. The old Brutus was
a patrician, as it is said, and the younger
liberator was a plebeian3 but this of itself
would not show Cicero to be wrong.
Plutarch (Brutus, c. l) has some more
about this matter. He says that the king-
expeller was Marcus’ ancestor3 and he
meets the objections made to Marcus' ‹lc-
scent on the ground that the sons of the
king-expellor were put to death, by quoting
Posidonius. who says that an infant re-
mained from whom the race of Marcus
Brutus came. The pedigree of M. Brutus
however is doubtful. So good a man
would not care whether he came from a
king-expellor or a bailiff, as the story
went.
