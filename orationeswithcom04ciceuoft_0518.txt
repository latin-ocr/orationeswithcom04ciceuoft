hereditatum ausum esse facere, quum ipse hereditatem patris non
adisses.

XVII. Haec ut colligeres, homo amentissime, tot dies in aliena
villa declamasti? quamquam tu quidem, ut tui familiarissimi dicti-
tant, vini exhalandi. non ingenii acuendi caussa declamitas. At
vero adhibes joci caussa magistrum, suffragio tuo et compotorum
tuorum rhetorem, cui concessisti ut in te quae vellet diceret, salsum
omnino hominem, sed materia facilis est in te et in tuos dicta dicere.
Vide autem quid intersit inter te et avum tuum. Ille sensim dice-
bat quod caussae prodesset; tu cursim dicis aliena. At quanta
merces rhetori data est! Audite, audite, patres conscripti, et
cognoscite rei publicae vulnera. Duo millia jugerum campi Leon-
tini Sex. Clodio rhetori assignasti, et quidem immunia, ut populi

Romani tanta mercede nihil sapere disceres.

hereditatem . . . adisses] He had not
taken possession of the Hereditas of his
father, which may have happened because
his father exheredated (disinherited) him,
as Halm supposes. But it is more likely
that Cicero means that the succession was
so encumbered with debt that Antonius did
not take possession ; for if he had done so,
he would have had to pay the debts. The
Praetor could in such case allow permission
not to take possession, and then the pro-
perty would be sold to pay the debts, as far
as it would go. In the time of Gaius this
»was the rule: “ Sui et necessarii heredes ’'—
a description which comprehends sons and
daughters and a son's descendants, if they
were all in the power of the deceased at
his death,—were Heredes whether they
chose or not. and whether they were Heredes
by testament or by intestacy3 and this was
the reason why they were called ‘neces-
sarii :’ ‘¹ Sed his Praetor permittit abstinere
se ab hereditate ut potius parentis bona
veneant.’' ‘Hereditatem adire' was the
technical term used to express the taking
possession of a succession (Gaius ii.
167 .

127. aliena villa] In the villa that had
belonged to Scipio, the father of Cn. Pom-
peius’ last wife, Cornelia (Phil. v. c. 7).
Cicero speaks of Antonius' preparation for
his speech in a letter to Cassius (Ad Div.
xii. 2), ‘⁶ quum in villa Metelli complures
dies commentatus esset.'' Metellus is P.
Cornelius Scipio, who was adopted by Q.
Caecilius Metellus, and took the name of Q.
Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio. He was con-
sul 13.c. 52 with Cn. Pompeius—⁶ ingenii
acuendi? ‘ingeniendi' V. Halm suggests
that the true reading may, be ‘ingenii exer-

Num etiam hoc,

cendi.’ — ‘ declamitas ε’ ‘ declamas' V.

Halm.

mayistrum] Sex. Clodius Siculus the
rhetoricum—⁴ dicta :⁷ ‘ sharp things, abuse,’
as practice for Antonius to reply to.
Suetonius calls Clodius ⁸ dicax! ‘Dic-
tum dicere ' is one of Cicero's expressions.
See Pro P. Quintio, c. 3, and the note on
‘ dicax,' Vol. ii. Suetonius in his notice of
Sex. Clodius (De Illust. Rhet. 5), quotes
‘Adhibes joci . . . dicta dicere ς’ but he
has ⁴ concessisti ut in quem vellet diceret.'

avum] The great orator M. Antonius,
who spoke ‘ sensim,' ‘ cautiously,’ ⁴ circum-
speetly.' Antonius in Cicero De Oratore
(ii. c. 72) explains the method of his art.
He was the first of all advocates. ‘⁴ Ego,
mehercule, Antoni, semper is fui qui de te
sic praedicarem, unum te in dicendo mihi
videri tectissimum, propriumque hoc esse
laudis tuae nihil a te unquam esse dictum
quod obesset ei pro quo diceres ’' (De Or. ii.
c. 73). Cicero says of Antonius in the
Brutus, e. 37: “Omnia veniebant An-
tonio in mentem, eaque suo quaeque loco,
ubi plurimum proficere et valere possent,
ut ab imperatore equites, pedites, levis
armatura, sic ab illo in maxime opportunis
orationis partibus collocabantur.”

At quanta . . . disceres] Quoted by
Suetonius, but he has ‘ audite ' only once,
and omits ¹ populi Romani.' The Campus
Leontinus was a fertile tract in Sicily, which
was the native island of Clodius (see Vol.
i. IndeX, ‘ Leontinus Campus’). Clodius was
to have his land free from all payments to
the Roman state (immunia). See Verr. ii.
3, c. 6, and the note. The ⁴ populus Ro-
manus ' paid for Antonius' rhetorical lessons,
but he was too stupid to learn.
